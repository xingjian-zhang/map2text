You will be provided with a few key ideas from recent Computer Science papers. Your task is to generate a novel and reasonable key idea based on the given contexts. Follow these steps for better generation: \n1. Summarize the themes to which the provided papers belong and identify the overarching themes connecting all of them. \n2. Identify some topics and connections that can bridge these papers, even if they are not exactly in the same field. \n3. Analyze the common or related methodologies employed in these studies and list these methodologies. \nUsing the insights gained from the above steps, including common themes, connected bridges, and related methodologies, brainstorm potential key ideas that logically extend from these discussions. Ensure that your generated key ideas are complete sentences that have similar formats to the provided key ideas. \nStructure your response in a JSON format, with each predicted key idea accompanied by a brief rationale.

They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable.
