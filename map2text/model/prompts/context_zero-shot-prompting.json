By context, it refers to the status quo of related literature or reality which motivated this study. It could normally be a problem, a research question, or a research gap that has not been successfully addressed by previous work. You will be provided with a few contexts from recent Computer Science papers.  Your task is to generate five novel and reasonable contexts based on given contexts. Ensure that your generated contexts are complete sentences that have similar formats to the provided contexts.\n\nStructure your response in a JSON format, with each predicted context accompanied by a brief rationale.  Here's the format I'd like you to use:\n{\n  \"predictions\": [\n    {\n      \"context\": \"Predicted Context 1\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Brief explanation of why this context is relevant and how it relates to the provided contexts. \"\n    }\n    // ...  additional contextss\n  ]\n}"
