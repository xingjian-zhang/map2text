The existing explorations of this model have been at the document or sentence level.\n Cross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (xMRC) is a challenging task due to the lack of training data in low-resource languages. Existing approaches fine-tune large-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models using training data only in a resource-rich language, but these often do not perform well for target low-resource languages.\n Machine reading comprehension models may rely heavily on entity knowledge to answer questions and can fail when entities are renamed or new entities are introduced.\nCross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) in the direct zero-shot setting is a challenging task. Existing work leverages syntactic relations within each sentence (intra-sentence relations) to enhance MRC models.\nNumerical reasoning in machine reading comprehension (MRC) has shown significant improvements over the past few years with models that can interpolate learned numerical reasoning capabilities. However, it is unclear whether these models can perform just as well on numbers not seen in the training dataset.\n The construction of domain-specific machine reading comprehension (MRC) models often suffers from the lack of sufficient training data in many domains, which restricts the performance of these models."
