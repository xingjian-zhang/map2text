By context, it refers to the status quo of related literature or reality which motivated this study. It could normally be a problem, a research question, or a research gap that has not been successfully addressed by previous work. You will be provided with a few contexts from recent Computer Science papers. Your task is to generate five novel and reasonable contexts based on the given contexts. Follow these steps for better generation: \n1.  Summarize the common themes, fields, or gaps mentioned by the provided contexts to understand the overarching research directions they represent. \n2.  Identify key topics and connections that can bridge these papers and reveal possible new contexts for exploration, even if the papers are from slightly different fields.\nUsing the insights gained from the above steps, including common themes or gaps and connected bridges, brainstorm potential contexts that logically extend from these discussions. Ensure that your generated contexts are complete sentences that have similar formats to the provided contexts. \nStructure your response in a JSON format, with each predicted context accompanied by a comman themes and connected bridges. Here's the format I'd like you to use: \n{\n  \"predictions\": [\n    {\n      \"common themes\": \"Summarize the common themes of the provided papers\",\n      \"connected bridges\": \"List the connected topics and bridges between the papers\",\n   \"context\": \"Predicted context 1\"\n    }\n    // ... additional contexts\n  ]\n}"

Existing approaches fine-tune large-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models using training data only in a resource-rich language, but these often do not perform well for target low-resource languages.\n Machine reading comprehension models may rely heavily on entity knowledge to answer questions and can fail when entities are renamed or new entities are introduced.\nCross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) in the direct zero-shot setting is a challenging task. Existing work leverages syntactic relations within each sentence (intra-sentence relations) to enhance MRC models.\nNumerical reasoning in machine reading comprehension (MRC) has shown significant improvements over the past few years with models that can interpolate learned numerical reasoning capabilities. However, it is unclear whether these models can perform just as well on numbers not seen in the training dataset.\n The construction of domain-specific machine reading comprehension (MRC) models often suffers from the lack of sufficient training data in many domains, which restricts the performance of these models."
