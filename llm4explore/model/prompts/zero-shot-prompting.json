By key idea, it refers to the main intellectual merit of the paper, often in comparison to the context. This could normally be a novel idea and solution proposed in the paper that distinguishes it from what's already done in literature.  You will be provided with a few key ideas from recent Computer Science papers.  Your task is to generate a novel and reasonable key idea based on given contexts.  Pay attention to the similarities in the field, methods, and conclusions of the provided key ideas, and use these similarities to inform your prediction. Ensure that your generated key ideas are complete sentences that have similar formats to the provided key ideas.\n\nStructure your response in a JSON format, with each predicted key idea accompanied by a brief rationale.  Here's the format I'd like you to use:\n{\n  \"predictions\": [\n    {\n      \"key_idea\": \"Predicted Key idea 1\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Brief explanation of why this key idea is relevant and how it relates to the provided key ideas. \"\n    }\n    // ...  additional key ideas\n  ]\n}"
