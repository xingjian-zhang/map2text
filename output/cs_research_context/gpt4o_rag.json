However, this may fail to deliver stable model performance due to the uncertainty in the sampling procedure.\nKnowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities in a knowledge graph. Existing methods primarily rely on entity embedding.\nExisting methods for designing expressive representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph (KG) have focused primarily on learning from relational patterns and structural information, largely overlooking the intrinsic complexity of KG entities.\nCurrent embedding-based knowledge graph completion models predict facts based on entities seen in training. However, they struggle with open-world link prediction, i.e., predicting facts for unseen entities based on their textual description.\nExisting knowledge graph embedding (KGE) based methods represent individual entities and links in knowledge graphs (KGs) as vectors in a low-dimension space.

However, many KGEs use Euclidean geometry, which limits their ability to preserve complex structures and often leads to incorrect inferences by the models.\nKnowledge graphs are incomplete, representing only a limited number of observed facts from world knowledge. The task of link prediction or knowledge graph completion has been attempted with both linear and non-linear models. Bilinear models have been used but are prone to overfitting and lead to quadratic growth of parameters in the number of relations. Simpler models have become more common, with certain constraints on bilinear map as relation parameters.\nCurrent knowledge graph (KG) embeddings can model only a single global hierarchy and fail to capture multiple heterogeneous hierarchies that exist in a single KG.\nKnowledge graphs represent relational information in terms of triples and embedding models can be used to make predictions of new triples. Subclass and subproperty information, or background taxonomic information, often exists, but cannot be provably respected by existing fully expressive (universal) models.\nThe knowledge base completion problem is usually formulated as a link prediction problem, but this formulation struggles to handle scenarios with multi-fold relations in the knowledge base. Also, conventional link prediction tasks have linear computational complexity in relation to the size of the knowledge base, which could be prohibitive for large datasets.\nExisting embedding models for knowledge base completion have their loss functions decomposed into atomic loss functions, each on a triple or an postulated edge in the knowledge graph. These models assume that if the triple is factual, it is independent of the structure of the knowledge graph, which may not be sufficient in diverse and complex knowledge bases.\nCurrent models for embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) focus on discriminating relation-specific information from entities via elaborate feature engineering, thereby potentially suffering from a high time and space complexity due to unique parameters learnt for each relation.\nExisting evaluation protocols of knowledge graph completion methods for link prediction rely on training with positive and negative triples and testing by ranking positive triples against negative counterparts. However, these protocols suffer from several shortcomings including imbalances in the number of negative counterparts, anomalies in benchmarking datasets, inappropriate splitting of datasets, and aggregation of ranks into a single metric.\nKnowledge graph completion involves predicting links between entities. Existing models like TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by considering a relation as a translation from a head entity to a tail entity. However, these models place entities and relations in the same semantic space, which may be insufficient due to the multiple aspects an entity may have and the varying focus of different relations."

The inductive setting, allowing entities in the testing phase to be unseen during training, is closer to real-life scenarios but requires entity-independent relation modeling and discrete logical reasoning for interoperability.\nRecently, transition-based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods have achieved promising performance, where the single relation vector learns to translate head entity to tail entity. However, this scoring pattern is not suitable for complex scenarios where the same entity pair has different relations.

However, fine-tuning PLMs in an end-to-end (E2E) manner for CCF is resource-intensive due to its multi-modal nature: optimization involves redundant content encoding for interactions from users.\nPretrained language models (PLMs) have significantly improved text generation, but can produce unfaithful or inappropriate content. On the other hand, template-based systems offer faithfulness, but lack fluency.\nPre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been widely used in passage re-ranking tasks due to their natural language understanding capabilities.

Current CLL models try to model the relationship between a complementary label and the ground truth label.

However, how to construct efficient contrastive samples through data augmentation is key to its success and has not been investigated sufficiently in language tasks.\nContrastive Learning (CL) has been successful in learning feature representations and achieving high performance on downstream tasks. However, the question of whether it can preserve adversarial robustness across tasks remains. In the self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning paradigm, adversarial robustness may be forgotten due to a learning task mismatch.\nContrastive representation learning, which uses unlabeled data, has been efficiently used in the vision domain with the help of specifically crafted data augmentations using domain knowledge."

The recent COLES method incorporates traditional graph embedding and negative sampling into one framework and minimizes the trace difference between the within-class scatter matrix and the total scatter matrix.\nGraph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a new paradigm for learning graph representations without human annotations, but the success behind GCL remains unclear due to several critical design considerations.\nGraph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has been an emerging technique to learn generalizable representations from contrastive views. However, it is limited by factors such as altering the graph structure through data augmentation, which may interfere with the message passing scheme and lose intrinsic graph structural information, and by its conventional use of predefined contrastive views and handpicked parameters, failing to fully utilize the contrastive information.\nGraph contrastive learning (GCL) has proven a successful technique for graph representation learning where mutual information between paired graph augmentations is maximized. Existing data augmentation methods in GCL are manual trial-and-error, costly domain knowledge, or cumbersome searching, each limit efficiency and broad applicability.\nGraph contrastive learning (GCL) is a self-supervised learning approach to graph representation learning (GRL) that maximizes mutual information for similar instances.

However, current contrastive graph embedding models may fail under disjoint positive and negative distributions, which may naturally emerge during sampling in the contrastive setting.\nDespite the attraction that Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has received, there are some unclear aspects, such as the information encoded into learned representations and any general graph augmentation rules behind different augmentations.\nGraph representation learning is vital for real-world applications, but the effective learning of representations without human labelling remains a challenge. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) addresses this problem, but current GCL methods primarily sample node pairs based on node-level proximity, rarely considering community structures. As a result, two nodes from the same community might be sampled as a negative pair.\nSelf-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged with promising representation learning performance. However, the effectiveness of GraphCL relies on manual selection of data augmentations per dataset, which limits its general applicability due to the diverse nature of graph data.\nGraph contrastive learning (GCL) has led to state-of-the-art results on various downstream tasks. However, the graph augmentation step, a vital part of GCL, has not been thoroughly studied. In practice, the node embedding via graph augmentations is highly biased, somewhat restricting contrastive models' ability to learn discriminative features.\nGraph classification has wide applications and in many situations, labels are scarce or hard to get. Unsupervised learning is hence a natural paradigm but its performance often lags behind that of supervised learning. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) in computer vision models is seen to perform comparably to supervised models. Many theoretical and empirical works analyzing visual CL frameworks find that leveraging large datasets and task relevant augmentations is essential for CL framework success. However, graph CL frameworks report high performance while using much smaller data, and employing domain-agnostic graph augmentations (DAGAs) that can also remove essential information.\nContrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a successful method for unsupervised graph representation learning, where stochastic augmentation on the input graph is performed to obtain two graph views and maximize the agreement of representations. However, the design of graph augmentation schemes\u2014a crucial element in CL\u2014has often oversimplified by using uniform data augmentation schemes, leading to suboptimal performance.\nGraph contrastive learning (GCL), which uses graph augmentations to create different views for training graph neural networks (GNNs), has been successfully applied to graph benchmark datasets. However, existing GCL methods face challenges with real-world data, such as the need for manual graph augmentation and difficulty in handling class-imbalanced distribution.\nGraph contrastive learning is the state-of-the-art unsupervised graph representation learning framework. However, its robustness to adversarial attacks is untested because most current graph adversarial attacks are based on supervised models, which heavily rely on labels and are only useful in specific scenarios.\nContrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as an effective technique for unsupervised representation learning. While CL can benefit from hard negatives, the application of existing hard negative mining techniques to Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has seen limited success.\nCurrent graph contrastive learning methods rely on the vector inner product based similarity metric and manually constructed positive/negative samples. However, these methods may fail to capture the intrinsic local structures of the graph, and the chosen similarity metric may not fully exploit the local structures to characterize the graph difference effectively.\nUnsupervised graph representation learning, particularly graph contrastive learning, has garnered attention for its promising performance in various tasks. However, current methods largely focus on augmenting or perturbing graph structures to generate contrasting pairs, but this can introduce noise and limit the application scope of graph contrastive learning.\nGraph contrastive learning has seen significant progress but existing works have not explored non-aligned node-node contrasting for node-level representation learning.\nContrastive learning is an effective unsupervised method in graph representation learning, and has been recently extended from images to graphs. However, most of these works are simply adaptations of models designed for images, which make data augmentation on graphs less intuitive and difficult to provide high-quality contrastive samples.\nSupervised contrastive (SupCon) learning has been recently proposed for classification tasks, but it could be difficult to handle datasets with large intra-class variances and high inter-class similarities. This issue is even more challenging when it comes to graph structures."

High performance computing in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence is in need of more efficient computational methods.\nTraining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is time-consuming and prior work has attempted to reduce the computational demands by eliminating gradients with relatively small magnitude.\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) accuracy generally improves with high resolution images, however, this increases computational cost and memory footprint.\nCurrent architectures for landmark localization using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly performant but not suitable for applications with limited computational resources.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have significantly improved computer vision performances over the recent years, with applications deployed on general purpose hardware like CPUs, GPUs or FPGAs. However, the considerations for mobile and embedded applications include factors like power consumption, speed, accuracy, memory footprint, and die size.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are ideal for safety-critical applications but ensuring reliability in the presence of possible memory faults is a challenge. Traditional methods such as error correction codes (ECC) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) are not specifically designed for CNNs and lead to significant memory overhead and energy costs.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are computationally intensive, limiting their applications on mobile devices due to high energy usage from multiple convolutions. Sparse Winograd methods can reduce this operation count but cannot be directly combined with network pruning, as applying the Winograd transform end up filling the sparsity in both the weights and the activations.\nTraining Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for large datasets like Imagenet can be time-consuming. Previous works have attempted to improve across multiple GPUs performance by improving the underlying optimization algorithm.\nCurrent convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for semantic segmentation under resource constraints are inefficient in terms of speed and performance.\nDeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly large in size and computationally intensive, which makes them difficult to deploy on devices with limited resources. Existing methods for network pruning focus on reducing less-important layers in a network, but this approach generally changes the original network structure.\nDensely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) are suffering from redundancy due to the need to integrate all previous outputs, leading to inefficient feature fusion and increased complexity.\nWhile convolutional neural networks (CNN) based object detectors have improved substantially in terms of accuracy, they are often too computationally intensive for real-time applications. Model compression methods can reduce these computation requirements, but they normally result in significant accuracy losses.\nCurrent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) usually utilize full-precision networks and preserve floating-point information using a set of discrete values, often referred to as value approximation. Such models are not ideal for mobile devices with limited power capacity and computation resources.\nWhile deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have contributed to groundbreaking results in machine learning and computer vision, vector processing hardware such as GPUs has played a vital role in modern CNN implementations. However, little research has been dedicated to vectorization for scaling up CNNs.\nDeep CNN models have become state-of-the-art techniques in many applications like face recognition, speaker recognition, and image classification. Many studies focus on the speedup or compression of individual models, but very few studies focus on co-compressing and unifying models from different modalities.\nVery deep and wide Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in various computer vision tasks but the significant storage requirement of such networks impedes their deployment on computationally limited devices.\nInception modules in convolutional neural networks have been identified as being an intermediate step between regular convolution and depthwise separable convolution operation, which consists of a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in various computer vision related tasks but are extremely computationally intensive and power hungry to run on mobile and embedded devices. Recent pruning techniques can reduce the computation and memory requirements of CNNs, but a costly retraining step is needed to restore the classification accuracy of the pruned model.\nExisting methods for accelerating the test-time computation of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) focus on approximating linear filters or linear responses and do not take into account the nonlinear units.\nRegular convolutional neural networks suffer from high sample complexity and limited symmetry exploitation capabilities."

However, many KGEs use Euclidean geometry, which limits their ability to preserve complex structures and often leads to incorrect inferences by the models.\nIn KG embeddings, entities and relations are embedded into a single geometric space such as Euclidean, hyperbolic, or hyperspherical space to maintain their geometric structures like chain, hierarchy and ring structures.

The inductive setting, allowing entities in the testing phase to be unseen during training, is closer to real-life scenarios but requires entity-independent relation modeling and discrete logical reasoning for interoperability.\nThe effectiveness of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) largely depends on the ability to model intrinsic relation patterns and mapping properties.

However, in practical applications, data is usually collected in a streaming fashion, which requires continual learning techniques to avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nMost existing Vision-and-Language (V&L) models rely on pre-trained visual encoders, using a small set of manually-annotated data to understand the visual world. Better generalization performance has been observed with large-scale pretraining models like CLIP, which are trained on a massive amount of image-caption pairs.\nExisting vision and language pre-training (VLP) methods have primarily focused on feature extraction and alignment between visuals and text, but overlooked the crucial impact of in-batch hard negative sampling for image-text matching (ITM) and large masking probabilities for masked language modeling (MLM).\nVisual-linguistic pre-training (VLP) methods are effective in image-text retrieval tasks but suffer from inefficiencies when applied naively due to the modality incompleteness of the task, where the query is either an image or a text and not an image-text pair. Existing VLP methods fail to extract comparable representations for single-modal queries and multi-modal database items.\nLinguistic representations derived from text alone have been criticized for their lack of grounding, i.e., connecting words to their meanings in the physical world. Vision-and-Language (VL) models, trained jointly on text and image or video data, have been offered as a response, but it is not yet known how those representations compare to text-only models."

                "content": "Predict new context based on these contexts: Existing methods for distinguishing instances of the same object category have exhibited the problem of catastrophic forgetting.\nOnline continual learning, where a model learns from a continuous stream of data without revisiting previously encountered data instances, is a challenging scenario. Catastrophic forgetting is worsened in this scenario as the model has to address forgetting at both the task-level and the data instance-level within the same task.\nContinual Learning (CL) is a process that sequentially learns new tasks, aiming for better Stability (remembering past tasks) and Plasticity (adapting to new tasks). However, due to the absence of past training data, the difference in the influence on Stability and Plasticity among training examples has not been explored adequately.\nContinual learning (CL) is a setting in which a model learns from a stream of incoming data without forgetting previously learned knowledge. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been applied successfully in continual learning of different natural language problems. Moreover, an array of continual learning methods and PLMs are undergoing rapid development.\nContinual learning (CL) is a crucial problem in the field of machine learning, where agents have to learn from a sequentially incoming stream of data, solving new problems over time while retaining previous knowledge. However, existing solutions face challenges of catastrophic forgetting (CF), high memory costs, and lack of theoretical understanding of neural networks' behavior when learning new tasks.\nContinual learning is a recent challenge in machine learning where models train well on the most recent data but face catastrophic forgetting of previous data due to shifting distributions, a problem that current replay-based methods attempt to solve with a small historical replay buffer.\nContinual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, recent advances in CL are limited to supervised continual learning (SCL) scenarios, which are not scalable to real-world applications because data in such scenarios is often biased and unannotated.\nCatastrophic forgetting is a challenge in neural networks where the system 'forgets' previously learned knowledge when learning new tasks. Existing methods have primarily focused on overcoming this issue in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which handle grid-based data like images, while largely overlooking graph neural networks (GNNs) that deal with non-grid data.\nCatastrophic forgetting (CF) frequently occurs when learning with non-stationary data distribution. CF is a significant challenge in sequential domain meta-learning (SDML), a process that involves meta-learning on a sequence of domains (datasets) but remains nearly unexplored.\nContinual Learning (CL), which refers to learning multiple tasks sequentially without forgetting previous knowledge, remains a long-standing challenge for neural networks. Existing methods typically rely on adding network capacity or data replay.\nMost research in continual learning has focused on mitigating catastrophic forgetting in feed-forward classification networks. However, the area of continual learning of recurrent models applied to problems like image captioning has been given little attention.\nCommon architectures in object detection are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, where they forget what has been learned when updating their parameters in the absence of the original training data. Existing works have extended standard classification methods in object detection task, often by adopting the knowledge distillation framework.\nThe problem of catastrophic forgetting in the context of class-incremental learning for video recognition hasn't been actively explored, though continual learning is popular.\nCatastrophic forgetting presents a challenge in developing deep learning models capable of continual learning (learning tasks sequentially), especially with the rapid progress in computer vision and natural-language processing using large-scale pretrained models.\nDeep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning incrementally, making it difficult to apply them in many tasks. Current methods mitigate this by maintaining a handful of samples (exemplars) from each task, but these are often too few to hold enough task-specific knowledge, keeping the forgetting problem persistent.\nContinual Learning (CL) methods mainly aim to avoid catastrophic forgetting and learn representations transferable to new tasks. SupSup, a CL method proposed by Wortsman et al. (2020), uses a fixed base network and finds a supermask for each new task to selectively keep or remove each weight to produce a subnetwork. However, the performances of the supermask are sub-optimal due to the fixed weights' restricted representational power and no knowledge transfer when new tasks are learned.\nContinual learning methods are needed that learn from data, while minimizing memory footprint and power consumption. While memory replay techniques have been promising in addressing this task, the best method for deciding which buffered images to replay is still a debated question.\nContinual learning is a growing paradigm in machine learning where a model, exposed to data from multiple different distributions in an online manner, is expected to adapt to changes in the distribution without increasing the model size. However, this setup has drawn attention primarily in applied studies, without formalization of its theoretical guarantees.\nCatastrophic forgetting is a common problem in neural networks, where the network loses information about the first task after being trained on a second task.\nClassical deep neural networks suffer from sharp performance degradation when trained sequentially on new or evolving tasks, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing solutions either store old data samples or only update a parameter set of deep neural networks, but these approaches demand a large memory budget or limit the flexibility of models to learn incrementally."

                "content": "Predict new context based on these contexts: Out-of-distribution example detection is crucial in safety-critical machine learning applications, but prior research has predominantly focused on simple, small-scale settings.\nDeep neural networks can be easily biased towards undesirable features, resulting in poor generalization. There have been efforts to de-bias these features using out-of-distribution (OOD) examples, and a recent study demonstrates successful undesirable feature removal at the softmax layer. However, this approach is confined to classification tasks and does not sufficiently explore its impact on a DNN feature extractor.\nDeep neural networks perform well with in-distribution data but can significantly degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Current methods for OoD detection often rely on training or tuning with both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, which can be difficult to define a-priori and may lead to bias in learning.\nDeep learning systems frequently fail at out-of-context (OOC) prediction, that is predicting on uncommon, unusual or distinctive subgroups of the training distribution. There have been recent introductions of benchmarks for measuring OOC performance.\nThe use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications is hindered because of their poor performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data as compared to in-distribution (ID) data. Several promising approaches for improving OOD robustness, including model pruning, data augmentation, and ensembling, have been developed, but there isn't a clear understanding of the conditions on OOD data and model properties that lead to effective robustness.\nDeep learning methods are crucial for commercially important applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics. However, reliably detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs while employing these algorithms is a challenge.\nOverconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a problem for deep neural networks. Current strategies seek to build a subset of OOD samples and then suppress predictions on them.\nDiscriminative neural networks often perform poorly on data that is not generated by the same process as the training distribution, especially in applications such as bacteria identification based on genomic sequences. Thus, there is a need for a model that can confidently handle out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs.\nThe problem of distinguishing between in-distribution (sample from the same distribution as training data) and out-of-distribution (distinct samples) arises often in machine learning applications but is not handled well by current deep neural networks, which tend to be overconfident in their predictions. Prior works attempted to manage this issue with inference procedure enhancements and threshold-based detectors; however, their performance depends heavily on the training of classifiers.\nDetermining whether inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) is an essential building block for safely deploying machine learning models. However, previous methods relying on the softmax confidence score suffer from overconfident posterior distributions for OOD data.\nExplanation Regularization (ER) is a method designed to improve language model generalization by aligning machine rationales with human rationales. However, its effect on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has been largely unexplored thus far.\nDeep generative models (DGMs) have been observed to assign higher probabilities or densities to out-of-distribution (OOD) images than images from the training distribution, indicating a failure in OOD detection.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for decision making processes and is commonly done through deep ensembles where the variance of predictions over different neural networks substitutes for input uncertainty. However, understanding the inductive biases leading to the performance of deep ensemble's uncertainty estimation is still not investigated.\nBuilding sample-efficient agents that generalize out-of-distribution (OOD) in real-world settings remains a fundamental unsolved problem in higher-level cognition research.\nDomain generalization techniques aim to improve generalization capabilities of machine learning systems to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, often by tackling issues arising from such data in stationary and discrete environments. However, real-world tasks in non-stationary environments often involve complex, continuously evolving domain drift that poses new challenges.\nThere is a growing concern about neural networks' sensitivity to distribution shifts, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. However, most of the research in this domain focuses on Euclidean data, leaving the understanding and handling of distribution shifts on graph-structured data largely unexplored.\nFor safety-critical applications of deep neural networks, it is crucial to determine when new inputs significantly deviate from the training distribution. This task is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.\nOut-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization algorithms, which deal with distributional shifts are gaining attention but often ignore the variation in the quality of training data, which can harm their accuracy.\nThere often is a dilemma between ease of optimization and robust out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization in machine learning. Many OoD methods rely on penalty terms whose optimization is challenging, leading to them being either too strong to optimize reliably or too weak to achieve their goals.\nDeep learning models often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization, where the test data come from a different distribution than the training data. Designing a general out-of-distribution generalization framework for a wide range of applications is a challenging task because of the various kinds of distribution shifts encountered in real-world situations."

However, these simple perturbations could be sub-optimal as they are agnostic to the model being attacked.\nMany works have sought to explain the existence of adversarial examples, but so far there is no consensus on the explanation.\nThe transferability of adversarial examples is a challenging research question in the field of adversarial attacks. Existing methods have not been able to achieve satisfactory success rates against black-box defenses.\nMachine learned models are often required to abide by certain requirements, and there's a growing interest in developing approaches that can verify whether a model satisfies certain properties. Previous works focused specifically on adversarial example generation or robustness checking for this requirement.\nAdversarial machines, in which a learner competes against an adversary, have recently regained interest in machine learning. These machines take the form of saddle-point optimization, often with a separable structure but sometimes also with unmanageably large dimensions.\nAdversarial examples are typically constructed by perturbing an existing data point, and current defense methods are focused on guarding against this type of attack.\nAdversarial examples, which are perturbed inputs designed to mislead machine learning models, are a threat to the security of these models. Adversarial training, which incorporates these examples into training data to boost robustness, uses fast single-step methods to adapt to large datasets. However, this approach may lead to models learning to generate weak perturbations rather than defending against stronger ones, leaving them vulnerable to black-box attacks.\nAdversarial examples represent major concerns for security-critical applications due to their ability to reveal the blind spots of deep neural networks. The transferability of these adversaries can be used to launch attacks in black-box settings. Current adversary generation methods mostly rely on domain-specific data distribution.\nAdversarial examples threaten the reliability of deep-learning models. Although various heuristic defenses exist, they often fall prey to adaptive attacks. Moreover, most methods providing theoretical robustness guarantees fail to achieve non-trivial robustness with large-scale models and data.\nCurrent methods lack a general theoretical approach for analyzing the risk bound while learning in the presence of adversaries.\nAdversarial examples, characterized as malicious inputs to confuse machine learning models, are extensively studied in two types - sensitivity-based that introduce small changes resulting in a different model prediction, and invariance-based that induce minimal semantic changes altering the true label while maintaining model\u2019s prediction.\nIn adversarial learning, there is an ongoing cycle between attackers and defenders where new attacks are proposed, mitigated by new defenses, and then new attacks are proposed to break earlier defenses. However, it was unclear if there exist conditions where no further advancements in attacks or defenses can be made.\nAdversarial transferability is an important yet not fully understood aspect of deep learning, and numerous methods have been proposed to enhance transferability without a unified theory."

However, these simple perturbations could be sub-optimal as they are agnostic to the model being attacked.\nThe black-box transferability of adversarial perturbations has been examined before, however, changing an unseen model's decisions to a specific `targeted' class remains challenging. Existing methods are less suitable due to their reliance on class-boundary information that changes from one model to another, thus reducing transferability.\nAdaptive attacks have become the standard for evaluating defenses to adversarial examples, but current evaluations have been found to be incomplete.

Recent works suggest that the presence of robust and non-robust features is a key reason for the existence of adversarial examples and have studied their interactions in the feature space.\nThe problem of adversarial examples in machine learning has been tackled mostly from a game theoretic perspective. This entails viewing the interaction between the attacker and the classifier as a zero-sum game. However, previous works have predominantly allowed only one player to use randomized strategies.\nExisting attack techniques for evading adversarial example detection defenses often fall short as they over-optimize against one constraint at the cost of satisfying another, thus failing to find adversarial examples that are both misclassified by the model and detected as non-adversarial.\nIn adversarial learning, there is an ongoing cycle between attackers and defenders where new attacks are proposed, mitigated by new defenses, and then new attacks are proposed to break earlier defenses.

Previous understanding of adversarial examples and their properties is limited, and effective measures to discriminate adversarial examples from normal examples in adversarial regions are needed.\nDeep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are highly successful in machine learning but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\nDeep neural networks are increasingly used in high-stakes applications but are often treated as 'black boxes' and have been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in the real world.\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are recognized to be vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations applied to inputs. These imperceptible perturbations can easily mislead DNNs, posing robustness challenges.\nAdversarial samples of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been intensively studied on static images, but their extensions in videos have not been explored.

While vulnerability of image models to adversarial noise has been extensively researched, the vulnerability of video models is less explored.\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which result from adding small-magnitude perturbations to inputs. Different attack strategies have been proposed to generate these examples, but there is a need for methods that produce high perceptual quality examples more efficiently.\n3D deep learning models are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, similar to 2D models.

Detecting adversarial examples is a crucial requirement for robust classification frameworks.\nDeep Neural Nets (DNNs) can be fooled by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to images. Feature space targeted attacks, a mainstream method, perturb images by modulating their intermediate feature maps to minimize the discrepancy between intermediate source and target features. However, the current measure of discrepancy using pixel-wise Euclidean Distance unreasonably imposes a spatial-consistency constraint.\nNeural networks are prone to adversarial attacks. Most of such attacks either slightly alter the majority of the input's pixels or occlude it with a patch, deteriorating the input quality.\nDeep neural networks for video classification, similar to image classification networks, may be vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.\nFeatures of a pixel extracted by DNNs are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs generally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. Existing attack methods manipulate pixel-wise noise to create adversarial examples, which could fool deep neural networks.\nMany recent works have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to quasi-imperceptible input perturbations, yet practitioners cannot fully explain this behavior.\nDeep-learning-based methods have been showing vulnerability to adversarial examples, making their deployment in safety-critical tasks questionable.

Kernel methods, used to reduce this complexity by approximating the softmax operator, perform inconsistently across tasks and corpus and generally suffer performance drops when compared to the vanilla softmax attention.\nTransformers have been successful in sequencing tasks, however, the computation of the attention matrix, a key component, has quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. This makes them difficult to use for large sequences.\nThe demand for long-term forecasting, in scenarios such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning, is increasing. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover long-range dependencies, but face difficulties in uncovering reliable dependencies due to intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future. Efficiency limitations also lead to Transformers using sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions, resulting in an information utilization bottleneck.\nThe recently proposed Conformer model, which features a hybrid attention-convolution architecture, has become the standard model for various downstream speech tasks. However, systematic studies have revealed that the design choices of the Conformer model might not be optimal.\nIn the set2vec problem, or the task of extracting vector representations from an input set of variable number of feature vectors, recent models like transformers have seen success. However, such models have high computational costs. Alternatives like inducing-point attention and optimal transport kernel embedding (OTKE) aim to reduce computational cost, but employ fixed learnable queries in attention, which may be limiting.\nInterpreting the underlying dynamics of Transformers is of growing interest. While self-attention patterns were initially considered the primary option for interpreting Transformers, recent studies have indicated that integrating other components can provide more accurate explanations.\nThe Transformer architecture, especially its core components such as self-attention and contextual embeddings, have been widely used but not fully understood.\nTransformer encoder architectures are known for their efficiency but they utilize self-attention sublayers, which can be computationally intensive.\nThe Transformer-Kernel (TK) model is recognized for its reranking performance on the TREC Deep Learning benchmark and is considered a slightly less effective but efficient alternative to other Transformer-based architectures. TKL, a variant of TK with local self-attention, is developed to process longer input sequences for document ranking.\nTransformers based on the attention mechanism have achieved success in many domains, yet the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms impedes their ability to handle numerous tokens and scale up to bigger models. Existing methods mainly use similarity decomposition and associativity of matrix multiplication to create linear-time attention mechanisms, but reintroduce inductive biases such as locality at the cost of model generality and expressiveness.\nDot-product attention in Transformers have quadratic complexity with respect to the input length. Numerous approximations have been recently proposed for this issue. However, these approximations cannot be directly used with popular pre-trained language models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive corrective pre-training stage.\nExisting generative transformer models, used for synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution images, treat an image naively as a sequence of tokens and decode an image sequentially following the raster scan ordering.\nThe Transformer model, which uses dot-product attention to update entity representations, has been extensively used in various natural language processing tasks."

Current NER approaches, which incorporate non-local information, are computationally inefficient or offer only marginal improvements.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is traditionally learned using a high volume of annotated in-domain data, which makes its application to low-resource scenarios, few-shot, and zero-shot settings challenging.\nTraditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems use standard features and are trained with Conditional Random Field (CRF) for recognizing drug names from biomedical texts.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) models commonly face the challenge of nested entities which leads to the nested NER problem. Current region-based models struggle with effectiveness and efficiency due to high subsequence enumeration complexity.\nThe state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) systems are statistical machine learning models that can recognize unseen entities based on lexical and contextual information. However, such models can still make mistakes if its features favor a wrong entity type.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) has many important applications and has become a well-known problem. Unsupervised learning via bootstrapping is gaining researchers' interest because it does not require manually annotating training data. Dependency tree-based patterns have proved to be effective in Relation Extraction.\nExisting Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods apply unsupervised consistency training by augmenting the input sequence with token replacement, assuming annotations on the replaced positions unchanged.\nMultimodal named entity recognition (MNER) has begun to utilize images to improve the accuracy of NER in tweets. However, most of these methods use attention mechanisms to extract visual cues without considering whether the text and image are relevant. In practice, many tweet pairs are irrelevant, which could negatively impact multimodal model learning."

                "content": "Predict new context based on these contexts: Named entity recognition (NER) has been broadly divided into flat, overlapped (nested), and discontinuous NER, and these have been studied separately. Recently there has been interest in unified NER that tackles these three aspects with one model. Current best-methods are span-based and sequence-to-sequence models, which have their respective drawbacks such as focus only on boundary identification and exposure to bias.\nZero-shot cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) transfers knowledge from annotated data in source languages to unlabeled data in target languages. Existing methods based on the teacher-student distillation framework ignore the information in the intermediate layers of pre-trained language models, leading to loss of domain-invariant information during transfer.\nStatistical machine learning methods like Maximum Entropy and Conditional Random Fields that are used for Named Entity Recognition (NER) training tend to overfit when the available training corpus is limited, especially if the number of features is large or the number of values for a feature is large.\nNeural named entity recognition (NER) models often encounter the issue of over-confidence, which can deteriorate performance and calibration.\nSpan-based methods for nested named entity recognition (NER) with neural networks have shown potential, but they face issues such as degeneration when positive and negative instances overlap significantly. Additionally, they often have limited generalizability, as many entities in test sets do not appear in training sets.\nCross-domain Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to transfer the NER knowledge from high-resource domains to low-resource target domains which is a challenging task due to domain shift and limited labeled resources.\nExisting span-based named entity recognition (NER) systems only perform shallow aggregation of token representations to span representations. This approach often results in ineffectiveness for long-span entities, coupling between representations of overlapping spans, and degraded performance.\nPrompt-based methods have been successfully applied in sentence-level few-shot learning tasks, mainly due to the sophisticated design of templates and label words. However, these methods are time-consuming when applied to token-level labeling tasks like named entity recognition (NER) because it requires enumerating the template queries over all potential entity spans.\nNamed entity recognition (NER) is normally divided into nested NER and flat NER, requiring different models since sequence labeling models, widely used for flat NER, are unsuitable for nested NER where a token may have multiple labels.\nDomain adaptation in named entity recognition (NER) is important as NER classifiers lose accuracy during the domain transfer due to different data distribution between the source and target domains. Generally, existing approaches require a significant amount of labeled target domain data to tune the original model, however, creating annotated training datasets for every target domain is labor-intensive and time-consuming.\nPrevious methods for cross-lingual named entity recognition (NER) with limited labeled data fell into two categories: model transfer and data transfer. However, these methods either exploited context information without task-specific information or used translated pseudo-target-language data with weakened context due to translation inaccuracies. They also rarely utilized abundant unlabeled target language data.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) methods are generally based on either sequence labelling or span classification. Unconstrained span-based methods often result in overlapping spans, which are undesirable especially for NER tasks without nested entities.\nMulti-modal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) typically uses image information through a pretrained object detector and relies on an attention mechanism to model interactions between image and text representations. However, this approach is difficult as image and text representations are trained separately on different data and not aligned in the same space.\nCurrent neural architectures in named entity recognition (NER) perform well on single domain data but suffer from overfitting and performance degradation when there is a domain shift between training and testing.\nFew-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims to generalize to unseen labels and/or domains with few labeled examples. Existing metric learning methods compute token-level similarities between query and support sets, but struggle to incorporate label semantics into their models.\nNested named entity recognition (NER), which deals with overlapping entity spans in text, is commonly approached with span-based methods. These methods generate a score matrix, but previous work overlooks the spatial relations within this matrix.\nNamed entity recognition (NER) suffers from the scarcity of annotated training data, especially for low-resource languages without labeled data. Cross-lingual NER aims to mitigate this issue by transferring knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, but it is severely affected by the quality of translation or label projection.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is traditionally performed using supervised learning methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). These methods, however, can face limitations in accommodating unlabeled data for improvement.\nMultimodal named entity recognition (MNER) on social media aims to extract named entities in free text and incorporate images to classify them, but its annotation demands a lot of human effort. Current semi-supervised named entity recognition methods primarily focus on the text modal and are utilized to reduce labeling costs, but they are not efficient for semi-supervised MNER due to the mismatch between the posted text and image.\nNested entities are observed in many domains due to their compositionality, which cannot be easily recognized by the widely-used sequence labeling framework. A natural solution is to treat the task as a span classification problem, but it requires effective integration of heterogeneous factors for better span representation and classification performance."

Current knowledge distillation methods for object detection mainly imitate features near bounding boxes, ignoring potentially beneficial features outside these areas and including detrimental features mistakenly identified as background by the teacher detector.\nRecently, a perspective has emerged suggesting that label smoothing is incompatible with knowledge distillation.

However, this knowledge is not always available in pose regression, and the teacher prediction is not always accurate.\nKnowledge distillation uses both real hard labels and soft labels predicted by teacher models as supervision. However, critical order violations between hard labels and soft labels in augmented samples have been found. These violations are common and injure the knowledge transfer.\nIn previous studies, such as those by Muller et al. (2019) and Shen et al. (2021b), there have been mixed findings on the compatibility between label smoothing (LS) and knowledge distillation (KD), but no effort has been made to understand and resolve these conflicting findings.\nTraditional object detectors are not designed for incremental learning, and fine-tuning them directly on a well-trained detection model with new data often results in catastrophic forgetting. Knowledge distillation is one solution to this problem but previous works in Incremental Object Detection (IOD) have concentrated mainly on distilling features and responses, often neglecting the valuable information contained in responses.\nIn prevalent knowledge distillation, logits in most image recognition models are computed by global average pooling, then used to learn to encode the high-level and task-relevant knowledge. The limitation of this global logit transfer in this distillation context is it prevents the transfer of informative spatial information.\nExisting knowledge distillation approaches based on feature-map transfer often manually assign target student layers to specific teacher layers, risking negative regularization due to potential semantic mismatches between these layer pairs."

The PointNet architecture, which operates on unstructured point clouds and gets promising results, processes each block of the input points individually.\nIn 3D object point cloud understanding, previous deep networks treat all points or local patches equally, thereby neglecting the complementary geometries between the contour and flat parts of objects.\n3D point cloud data is increasingly used in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, and the robustness of 3D deep learning models against adversarial attacks becomes a major consideration.\nSemantic learning on 3D point clouds using a deep network is challenging due to the naturally unordered data structure. Among existing works, PointNet has achieved promising results by directly learning on point sets.

However, existing methods for analyzing such data treat cross-modality relations as simple observation-fitting tasks, and do not effectively adapt to the complexities and divergence in multi-modal data.\nThe challenge of understanding scenes from multiple sources of sensor data when there is no one-to-one correspondence across modalities is a common scenario in multi-sensor data analysis. Previous solutions have addressed this by restricting interpretation to a single representation in one of the domains and augmenting features from other modalities.\nMulti-modal learning aims to relate information from multiple modalities, but two challenges include the difficulty of collecting a large, complete dataset containing all required modalities and the prevalence of high dimensional and noisy features on modalities.\nWhile diverse input data modalities can enhance model performance, there's often a discrepancy between available modalities at training and testing stages. At test time, certain modalities might be missing or noisy, posing a challenge to implement robust models.\nAcquiring and modeling data with multiple modalities has gained interest with affordable sensors. However, malfunctions or configuration issues can leave gaps in the data, and most existing multi-modal learning algorithms cannot handle these missing modalities, often discarding valuable information in the process.\nMany multi-modal learning approaches have been proposed to integrate information from different sources. However, due to issues such as data collection failures and self-deficiencies, multi-modal instances often suffer from incompleteness and inconsistent anomalies, which impacts the performance and generalization abilities of multi-modal learning algorithms.\nAs technology develops, multi-modal visual data are easier to access, but an underlying problem with the emerging multi-modality techniques is the potential failure of one or more modal data.\nThe majority of past multimodal fusion approaches work by either projecting the features of different modalities into the same space or by coordinating representations of each modality through the use of constraints.\nMulti-modality data, which can provide complementary information, are widely used in clinical applications such as tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. However, due to various reasons, some modalities are often missing for some subjects, leading to the problem of multi-modality missing data completion.\nMultiple modalities often co-occur when describing natural phenomena and learning a joint representation of these modalities should yield deeper and more useful representations. However, previous generative approaches to multi-modal input either do not learn a joint distribution or require additional computation to handle missing data.\nTemporal and semantic constraints on fusion are at the core of multimodal system processing. Current state-of-the-art models use fixed temporal thresholds, which do not account for individual differences in users' multimodal integration patterns.\nData generated from real-world events contain temporal and multimodal information like audio, visual, depth, sensor, etc., which need to be intelligently combined for classification tasks. Existing models struggle to effectively combine these diverse data types.\nTraditional studies have been exploring how data from different modalities can be optimally combined as a system, however, it's generally agreed that this information combining depends on the interpretation of the data. Furthermore, the causal relationships that are perceived by different modalities in their fusion process has not been given much emphasis.\nCurrent multimodal systems mainly treat each modality as a separately processed, increasingly abstracted pipeline where integration over abstract sensory representations happens at the last step.\nDeep learning has been successfully applied to multimodal representation learning problems, with a common strategy to learning joint representations that are shared across multiple modalities on top of layers of modality-specific networks. However, there still remains a question how to learn a good association between data modalities, in particular, a good generative model of multimodal data should be capable of reasoning about missing data modality given the rest of data modalities.\nCurrent methods for multimodal learning, which involves combining data from different modalities, have limitations in deciding how each modality influences the overall activation.\nData with multiple modalities are common in real-world clustering tasks. However, existing methods assume that pairing information for modalities is available for all instances, which is not always the case."

However, creating genuine task recommendations requires identification and analysis of task similarities.\nIn crowdsourcing data collection, it is often assumed that crowd workers complete tasks independently without direct communication.\nQuality insurance for crowd answers is a significant challenge as crowdsourcing involves a heterogeneous population, including many faulty workers. While various techniques for quality control have been developed, a post-processing phase, often requiring expert validation, remains necessary, making the process costly and time-limited.\nIn crowdsourcing, output agreement mechanisms are often used to incentivize participants to provide truthful answers when the correct answer is held by the majority. However, there is a lack of strategies to elicit effort, especially from a population of workers with heterogeneous cost of effort exertion.\nExisting crowdsourcing methodologies fail to adequately capture the wide range of opinions and perspectives represented in diverse human interpretations.

However, existing agreement measures are known to have many issues.\nIn the crowdsourcing task of learning the answer to simple multiple-choice microtasks, one often needs to ask multiple workers to answer the same microtask. A stopping rule is needed for deciding when to stop and output an answer or ask one more worker.\nMost prior work in crowdsourcing focuses on estimating the quality of each individual worker in tandem with the actual answer of each task, disregarding worker attributes such as education level, major, and age which could significantly influence their performance on certain tasks.\nCrowds are increasingly being used to solve complex problems, and they are often characterized by their size and diversity. However, the relationship between these two characteristics and performance is often paradoxical, and not well-understood.\nMachines cannot answer all the queries and some require human input for providing missing information, performing complex computations and for other operations.

However, the balance between solution discovery and selection can be hard to achieve.\nCrowdsourcing has become essential in a wide range of Web applications, but one of the biggest challenges is the quality of crowd answers due to wide-ranging levels of expertise and the presence of faulty workers. Various techniques for quality control have been proposed, but a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated by experts, who are often limited and incur high costs, is still required.\nIn the broad range of web applications, crowdsourcing is an essential tool. However, the varying expertise levels and presence of faulty workers necessitate quality control. Most crowdsourcing platforms have a post-processing phase where crowd answers are validated by experts, but this is cost-intensive.\nConsistency is a difficult challenge in crowd-powered systems in which constituent crowd workers may change over time.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of a crowdsourcing application and controlling the quality of the data it generates is challenging, due to the lack of tools to do so.\nCrowdsourcing is a technique used to outsource tasks to numerous workers. However, it risks leaking sensitive data such as task instances to workers, which has limited its widespread adoption.\nImproving the quality of work done by crowd workers on crowdsourcing platforms has been a focus in recent research in human computation. Strategies like filtering crowd workers through qualification tasks, and aggregating responses from multiple crowd workers to obtain consensus have been adopted.\nDomain experts in the sciences and humanities, who may not be technically savvy, struggle to create, monitor, and control complex crowdsourcing projects.\nQuality control in crowdsourcing is crucial to ensure quality task processing and reducing costs. Existing iterative improvement workflows for complex tasks rely on choosing the best result from multiple workflows. However, for sophisticated tasks that consist of numerous subtasks and specific constraints, this approach can lead to extra costs due to more iterations as it does not integrate contributions from all workflows.\nIn crowdsourcing, quality control and timeliness are critical. While quality control is extensively covered in literature, timeliness needs more research. Prior experiments on CrowdFlower indicate there are patterns related to task completion time.\nCurrent crowdsourcing research concentrates on improving the quality of responses. Identifying high and low quality workers would allow correction of errors in tasks. However, distinguishing between these types is challenging when no measure of individual success exists.\nTraditionally, crowd-powered systems implement crowd algorithms to improve crowd work through techniques like redundancy, iteration, and task decomposition. However, these approaches require substantial programming to package tasks for the crowd and apply crowd algorithms.\nCrowdsourcing applications are widespread in various scenarios but the quality of the outcome depends on varying design parameters.

Prior works propose smart graph sampling or partitioning strategies to train GNNs with a smaller set of nodes or sub-graphs.\nMost current GNN-based algorithms learn node representations incorporating k-hop neighbors' information for higher-order structural features. However, due to the high time complexity of querying k-hop neighbors, these graph algorithms cannot be deployed in giant dense temporal networks for millisecond-level inference, which limits their application in areas like financial fraud detection.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with weak generalization due to sparsely labeled data. Data augmentation is a prevalent method to improve model generalization in many domains, but it is challenging to design effective augmentation on graphs due to their non-Euclidean nature and dependencies between samples.\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks, but their success typically relies on the assumption that the original heterogeneous graph structure is reliable. However, in reality, these graphs are often noisy or incomplete.\nMulti-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a promising approach for mitigating the over-smoothing problem in GNNs, but little explanation exists as to why it works empirically from the viewpoint of learning theory.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used in multi-hop question answering tasks, but they have limitations such as unnecessary updates and overly simple edge construction that prevent accurate and interpretable answer span extraction.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful representation learning models on graphs, using a global model for information aggregation from neighboring nodes. However, different nodes have different local contexts within the graph, leading to diverse node distributions across the graph.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) model local graph structures and capture hierarchical patterns by aggregating information from neighbor nodes. However, determining the optimal number of aggregation iterations for each node in complex graphs and with sparse features is challenging.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) are growing in size and complexity, making their training and inference increasingly expensive. Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot address the space and computational challenges caused by the size and connectivity of the graph.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) strive to aggregate information from local neighborhoods for informative node representation.

This approach has been identified as having poor usability and inferior efficiency due to a large semantic gap between the API and the GNN models, high memory consumption, and massive data movement.\nHeterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been widely developed in recent years, but the unique data processing and evaluation setups used by each work obstruct a full understanding of their advancements.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) with their increasingly diverse graph convolution operations have proven powerful in dealing with high-dimensional non-Euclidean domains. However, the significant search space of GNNs due to their diverse components prevents classical Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods from being applied straightforwardly.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven to be effective in various network-related tasks. Most existing GNNs usually exploit the low-frequency signals of node features, raising questions about the effectiveness of only using low-frequency information in real-world applications.\nExisting explainability approaches for Graph Neural Networks (GNN) mainly focus on either local or global explainability, neglecting the need for a balanced view that incorporates both aspects.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNN) are used for learning on non-Euclidean data.

However, the use of PLMs for Hebrew is limited due to the lack of high-quality training resources compared to English, and the fact that necessary morphological boundaries are not provided by existing PLMs.\nPre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been effectively used in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with a denoising autoencoder framework being the most successful one, where the models learn to recover the original text from a noise-corrupted version. However, existing studies mainly focus on injecting noises into the input.\nPre-trained language models (PLMs) that use subword tokenization schemes can succeed at language tasks requiring character-level information, even without explicit access to the character composition of tokens.\nPre-trained language models (PLMs) usually incorporate a vast amount of parameters that hinder their deployability across multiple downstream tasks. The parameter-efficient transfer learning methods, which only fine-tune a few parameters, have been proposed to address this.\nPre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved noteworthy success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their large size limits their applicability in practical systems. Knowledge distillation, a technique to compress PLMs by learning a smaller model from a large model, is biased when learning from only a single model.\nSemantic parsing, which maps natural language to structured meaning representations, is fine-tuned using a pretrained language model (PLM). However, this approach is inefficient when tasked with multiple downstream tasks, as it needs to store a new set of values for all parameters of the pretrained language models for each separate task. Existing work has explored prefix tuning and bias-term tuning, methods to adapt pretrained language models while keeping most or all of their parameters frozen.\nPre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have proven effective in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they require large amounts of computational resources due to their high number of parameters. Model pruning is a common method for compressing large-scale PLMs; however, most current methods are focused on task-specific knowledge and tend to neglect the essential task-agnostic knowledge during pruning, leading to the catastrophic forgetting problem and poor generalization ability.\nFine-tuning of pretrained language models (PLMs) is utilized in numerous NLP tasks. However, a directly fine-tuned model often contains redundant parameters which contribute less to the downstream task, causing suboptimal performance of the overall model due to the gap between pretraining and downstream tasks.\nDomain-specific Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been proposed to enhance task performance within specific domains. However, this Domain Adaptive Pre-training (DAPT) tends to forget the previous general knowledge acquired by general PLMs, which leads to the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting and sub-optimal performance.\nCurrent large-scale Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have two challenges. They can be inefficient in terms of memory and computation, and they can struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, often relying on data set bias.\nDiscriminative pre-trained language models (PrLMs) work as denoising auto-encoders with an ennoising process that corrupts texts and a denoising process that restores them. Current studies have focused on optimizing either the ennoising or denoising strategies and treat all training instances equally, ignoring the individual instances' contribution.\nTransformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have advanced capacity but also excessive overhead, posing a challenge for resource-constrained devices. Existing statically compressed models do not account for the diverse complexities between input instances, potentially leading to redundancy and inadequacy. Early exit in miniature models also face the issue of balancing between making predictions and serving the deeper layers.\nPretrained text representations, such as context-free word embeddings and contextualized language models, have given rise to the widespread use of the pretrain-finetune paradigm in text mining. However, a significant drawback is the large amount of training data required for fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks, and the potentially high cost of acquiring human annotations.\nPre-trained language models (PLMs) learn universal language representations through self-supervised training tasks on large-scale corpora, however the quality of word representations tends to depend on their frequency in the corpus. As a result, the embeddings of rare words are often poorly optimized.\nRecent research shows synthetic data as a source of supervision helps pretrained language models (PLM) transfer learning to new target tasks/domains. However, this idea is less explored for spatial language.\nPretrained language models (PLMs) have seen remarkable progress in text generation tasks via fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning PLMs in data-scarce situations is challenging and there is a need for a general and lightweight model that can adapt to various text generation tasks."

However, a common limitation is that they cannot automatically capture the information of word order, typically requiring explicit position embeddings.\nTransformer-based models such as Transformer-XL and BERT have achieved success on various natural language processing tasks. However, they suffer from a degeneration problem where contextualized embeddings at the output layer tend to occupy an anisotropic cone in the vector space.\nBERTs are ineffective in processing long texts due to quadratically increasing memory and time consumption. Current solutions either use sliding window method or simplify transformers, but these methods fail due to insufficient long-range attentions or they need customized CUDA kernels.\nTransformer and its variants have achieved great success in natural language processing. Since Transformer models are large in size, deploying them for real industrial applications presents a challenge.\nLanguage models based on the Transformer architecture are successful, but their representations are observed to have anisotropic properties. Previous studies suggest that these representations occupy a narrow cone.\nExtrapolation from short problem instances to longer ones is a key form of out-of-distribution generalization in reasoning tasks, critical in scenarios where longer problem instances are rare, such as theorem proving, solving math problems, and summarizing novels. However, transformer-based language models have shown significant generalization deficiencies when naively fine-tuned on length generalization tasks.\nTransformer models have become widely used in natural language processing tasks. However, they require a substantial amount of computing resources to achieve high performance, which limits their applicability for mobile applications, which often have tight constraints on hardware resources and battery usage.\nRecent research has shown that increasing the input length or model size can improve the performance of Transformer-based neural models.\nTransformer has achieved great success in the NLP field by composing various advanced models like BERT and GPT. However, Transformer and its existing variants are not optimal for capturing token distances because the position or distance embeddings used by these methods typically do not hold the precise information of real distances, hindering the modeling of the orders and relations of contexts.\nDespite the popularity and success of transformer language models, understanding how they encode latent concepts within learned representations remains a challenge.\nCurrent transformer models face challenges modeling documents that contain large tables, as they are usually limited to 512 tokens. Moreover, more than 20% of relational tables on the web have 20 or more rows, making them rich yet difficult to model for information extraction.\nTransformer-based models, although achieving state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks including document summarization, struggle with memory and compute requirements as the input length grows. This presents challenges when dealing with long document summarization."

Existing methods exhibit high variance in performance from one run to another using different initializations/seeds, particularly in problems arising in continuous control.\nPolicy improvement in reinforcement learning (RL) typically oscillates between the greedy approach seen in value-based RL and the full planning approach seen in model-based RL.\nModel-based reinforcement learning algorithms with probabilistic dynamical models are amongst the most data-efficient learning methods. They usually distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty while learning the model but ignore this differentiation when optimizing the policy, which tends to result in greedy algorithms that do not explore sufficiently.\nReinforcement learning algorithms typically optimize the discounted criterion to accelerate convergence and reduce the variance of estimates. However, many engineering problems treat future rewards equally and prefer a long-run average criterion over the discounted one.\nMany recent successful (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms make use of regularization, such as entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence. These regularization methods often encompass policy iteration and value iteration strategies.\nPartially-observable reinforcement learning (PORL) and non-parametric Bayesian statistics (NPB) are two separate fields, and there is a need to address issues of statistical modeling and decision-making in complex, real-world domains.\nMost deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms distill experience into parametric behavior policies or value functions via gradient updates, which can be computationally expensive, slow to integrate experiences, prone to ignoring not fully integrated experiences, and limited by the model's capacity.\nThe existing modern deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are based on either the general policy improvement (GPI) or trust-region learning (TRL) frameworks, which prove unscalable. The scalable algorithms violate GPI/TRL assumptions due to the need for regularisation or other heuristics, and their empirical success currently explained as approximate adaptations of theoretically sound methods. However, studies have shown that these algorithms greatly differ from their conceptual ancestors in practice.\nNeural combinatorial optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) offers a strong heuristic solver for NP-hard problems but can suffer from issues, such as slow, unstable training and susceptibility to local minima due to high variance. Existing RL solvers are often taught by 'expert guides' with extensive domain knowledge.\nReinforcement learning techniques, specifically deep policy optimization methods, have been successful in complex tasks but have limitations. Their real-world adoption remains limited due to the significant amount of data required for success, with small sample sizes resulting in unstable learning due to their reliance on high-dimensional sample-based estimates.\nStandard deep reinforcement learning algorithms use a shared representation for the policy and value function, especially when training directly from images. This shared representation can lead to over-fitting, as more information is needed to accurately estimate the value function than to learn the optimal policy.\nModel-free deep reinforcement learning methods have been successful in various domains but they suffer from high sample complexity. Existing methods alternate between stable learning with high variance in batch policy gradient methods and sample-efficient yet biased TD-style methods like off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning.\nModel-based methods have recently achieved much higher sample efficiency than previous model-free methods for continuous-action Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) benchmarks due to a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio."

Traditional models that do not take into account social interactions or contextual information have proven insufficient.\nAccurately anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians in autonomous driving remains a challenge due to partial observability in dynamical scenes. Furthermore, in realistic environments, the future trajectories should be diverse and admissible, adhering to physical constraints and staying in drivable areas.\nCurrent deep learning approaches to autonomous driving perform impressively, but suffer from a lack of explainability. These models often act as black boxes, outputting decisions based on previously seen driving patterns without providing reasons for such decisions. This lack of understanding is a significant drawback, particularly when system failures occur.\nLearning driving policies from pre-recorded logs is a complex task, often requiring an innate understanding of the world's dynamics and the ego-vehicle's responses to them.\nAutonomous vehicles need to predict the future trajectories of surrounding traffic-agents (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) in order to navigate safely and efficiently in complex urban traffic. However, it is challenging to explore the movement patterns of different traffic-agents and to predict their future trajectories accurately.\nExisting paradigms for autonomous driving rely either on end-to-end or pipelined approaches for navigating and making decisions."

However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for training AI on non-ego vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, a significant amount of potential training data is being discarded in current approaches.\nRecent advances in intelligent vehicles have relied on quantitative approaches for autonomous driving, limiting their ability to handle complex situations like city traffic.\nFor planning safe maneuvers, an autonomous vehicle must accurately perceive its environment, and understand complex urban traffic interactions among participants, an area that requires improvement.\nExisting frameworks for predicting future trajectories of navigating participants in road scenes may not adequately consider the relational behavior between road users and their surrounding environment, limiting the effectiveness of the predictions.\nPredicting future movement of surrounding traffic actors is crucial for autonomous vehicles.

The common belief is that pruning methods utilize training data to find efficient subnetworks and the pruned network's architecture is crucial for satisfactory outcomes.\nNetwork pruning, a regularization method, speeds up training and improves the generalization of neural networks. However, directly using $L_0$ norm as a regularization term is challenging due to its non-differentiable nature.\nNetwork pruning, which aims to reduce the computational cost of neural networks, typically begins with an over-parameterized model that is then simplified by removing less important units. This process usually starts with training a large, redundant network.\nNetwork pruning is a common method used to lighten and accelerate neural network models. However, structured network pruning, which discards whole neurons or filters, leads to a loss in accuracy.\nCurrent network pruning reduces computation costs of an over-parameterized network without performance damage by pre-defining the width and depth of the pruned networks and then transferring the parameters from the unpruned network to the pruned networks.\nNetwork pruning, or removing unimportant weights from a trained network, can improve generalization, simplify networks, reduce hardware or storage requirements, and speed up further training. Existing methods for this often remove the wrong weights and don't permit the removal of many weights without increasing error on the training set.\nNetwork pruning has been traditionally used to alleviate the over-parameterization problem of deep neural networks. However, its value has been recently debated, particularly from the viewpoint of neural architecture search (NAS).\nAutomatic design of computationally efficient neural networks usually utilize network pruning or leverage network architecture search methods.\nWeight pruning is an effective method in reducing model size and computation cost, but conventional sparse matrix formats involve irregular index structures with large storage requirement and sequential reconstruction process. These inefficiencies restrict pruning to inference with a batch size of one.\nModel pruning is used to improve the computational efficiency of deep learning and is particularly useful for resource-limited scenarios. The prevalent assumption in model pruning is that smaller-norm parameters or features play less informative roles during inference.\nStructural pruning of neural network parameters helps to reduce computational, energy, and memory transfer costs during inference, however, efficient methodology to estimate the importance of neurons (filters) and iteratively prune them based on this estimation is needed.\nNeuron pruning is effectively used to compress networks for reducing computational cost and storage overhead. Existing methods typically operate in a layer-by-layer optimization mode, discarding unimportant input neurons and using the remaining ones to reconstruct output neurons. However, information loss cumulates as the number of layers increases because the remaining neurons do not completely encode the original information.\nReducing model redundancy is a key task to deploy complex deep learning models on resource-limited or time-sensitive devices. Pruning methods often directly regularize or modify weight values, making the pruning procedure sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters and requiring prior knowledge.\nModel pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a neural network's connection matrices to reduce the number of non-zero parameters in the model. Recent reports have shown that deep networks can be pruned with only a marginal loss in accuracy, hinting at potential over-parameterization in the baseline models.\nStructured weight pruning is a widely used model compression technique in deep neural networks (DNNs) to reduce storage and computation requirements and accelerate inference. However, a major challenge is the automatic determination of a large number of flexible hyperparameters.\nChannel pruning can accelerate and compress deep neural networks. Existing methods utilize structured sparsity regularization on each layer separately, overlooking the correlations between consecutive layers.\nWeight pruning is a widely acknowledged method to reduce redundancy in Deep Neural Networks (DNN), but most pruning techniques are trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, often leading to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance.\nIn deep neural networks, unstructured pruning reduces redundant weights for lower storage cost but requires hardware customization for efficient inference. Coarse-grained sparsity, another strategy to accelerate sparse model inference on general-purpose hardware, often sacrifices model accuracy.\nDynamic network pruning is a method used to achieve runtime acceleration by determining inference paths based on different inputs. However, existing methods directly generate continuous decision values for each weight channel, not providing a clear and interpretable pruning process.\nIn budgeted pruning, the problem of how to distribute the resources across layers is key. Traditional methods lack efficiency due to its discrete search for layer-wise pruning ratios."

The use of a suicide dictionary created by mental health experts has proven effective in detecting suicidal ideation. However, validation of these dictionaries for languages other than English and Chinese, particularly for low-resource languages like Korean where a knowledge-based suicide dictionary has not been developed, has been lacking.\nCurrent studies on suicide risk assessment on social media require large amounts of user-centric data and often analyze the user's historic timeline and their social network. There is a need for a less intrusive way of assessing such risk.\nThe utility of screening Twitter users for mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD is a field of interest, with existing work primarily utilizing lexical decision lists.\nPsychological stress detection has been a focus in health research. Previous work relied on the stressor dictionary from the stressor-related categories in the LIWC, focusing on stress categories that frequently appear on social media.\nThe advent of social media has created potential for early detection of depression, but current methods struggle to effectively use both textual and visual information from posts. Additionally, there is difficulty in accurately extracting relevant indicator texts and images due to the variety of content types.\nSocial media platforms are used for studying psycho-linguistic behaviors to model expressions of suicidal intent in tweets. Most existing methods in suicidal ideation detection don't leverage contextual psychological cues.\nMachine learning methods have been used to annotate mental health status in social media, as they can gather large training samples.

However, this model significantly reduces the inference latency, causing a quality drop compared to traditional Transformer models.\nNon-autoregressive approaches improve the inference speed of translation models by requiring only a single forward pass to generate the output sequence but their translation quality tends to lag behind their autoregressive counterparts due to output token interdependence.\nNon-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) has a multi-modality problem where the source sentence can have multiple correct translations, but the loss function is only calculated according to the reference sentence. Sequence-level knowledge distillation was used to make the target more deterministic but the multi-modality problem is still substantial. Also, learning from a specific teacher limits the capacity of the model and restricts the potential of NAT models.\nThe current problem that arises in training fully non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models is the effect of word reordering; a common source of the critical multimodality problem."

Existing actor-critic methods only use values or gradients of the critic to update the policy parameter.\nPolicy gradient methods are widely used to solve complex control problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most methods focus on choosing the step size while ignoring the batch size, which is the number of samples used to estimate the gradient direction for each update of the policy parameters.\nPolicy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that update by following a performance gradient estimate. Current methodologies use Monte Carlo techniques for this estimation. These methods, however, tend to have high variance and therefore require a large number of samples which leads to slow convergence.\nPolicy gradient methods in deep reinforcement learning have been successful but suffer from high variance of gradient estimates, which is particularly severe in problems with long horizons or high-dimensional action spaces.\nPolicy gradient methods are a prevalent class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, and a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient estimator variance. Some recent research has proposed extending the baseline to depend on both the state and action, arguing that it reduces variance and boosts sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates.\nPolicy gradient is a widely used approach in model-free reinforcement learning, but it tends to suffer from instability of gradient estimates.\nPolicy gradient methods are a popular choice for reinforcement learning. However, the theory and the specific mechanics of how they work is not entirely clear, including their relation to their value-based counterparts.\nQ-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, has always included an extension to eligibility traces for more rapid learning and improved asymptotic performance on non-Markov problems. The \u03bb parameter in off-policy algorithms such as Q(\u03bb), GQ(\u03bb), and off-policy LSTD(\u03bb) was intended to smoothly shift the learning from bootstrapping to Monte Carlo, but fails to approximate Monte Carlo learning when \u03bb = 1.\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), a commonly used actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control, suffers from overestimation that can hinder performance. The Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm mitigates overestimation but introduces a large underestimation bias.\nIn reinforcement learning, assuring convergence when using a compact hypothesis class for value function approximation is a lingering issue. The standard temporal-difference learning algorithm converges when the hypothesis class is a linear compilation of fixed basis functions, but may diverge with a non-linear (general) hypothesis class."

Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which seeks to identify test samples that significantly deviate from the training distribution, serves as a critical control mechanism to prevent system failures.\nDetecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is significant for the safe deployment of NLP models. Several prevalent methods for textual OOD detection, based on pretrained language models (PLMs), use a distance-based approach, by estimating sample distance scores in the last-layer CLS embedding space. However, these don't utilize the full spectrum of linguistic information in the PLMs.\nMiller et al. established the 'accuracy-on-the-line' phenomenon where a model's in-distribution (ID) accuracy strongly correlates with its out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy.

Existing OOD detection approaches primarily rely on the output or feature space for deriving OOD scores and overlook information from the gradient space.\nUnsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for machine learning reliability. Studies have shown that hierarchical VAEs can help detect OOD instances, but they suffer from an inherent issue known as 'posterior collapse' which limits their performance.\nDeep probabilistic generative models can model high dimensional data likelihoods and are expected to play a key role in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, a problematic issue is observed when certain types of OOD samples are assigned higher likelihoods by these models, causing likelihood threshold-based OOD detection rules to fail.\nThe problem of recognizing out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, inputs unrelated to the in-distribution task, is a crucial part of trustworthy machine learning. Numerous OOD detection methods have been proposed in recent years.\nDetection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data using dropout Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) has been attempted before, but previous methods leveraging randomized embeddings can fail due to the distance metric used.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial aspect when deploying machine learning models. Recently, many methods are using auxiliary outlier data to regularize models for better OOD detection. These approaches assume that the auxiliary outlier data is completely separable from the in-distribution data. \nThe task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. Existing methods often fail to adequately differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD features, which is a critical aspect in ensuring the robustness and reliability of machine learning models.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection and lossless compression are two problems that can be solved by training probabilistic models on a first dataset with subsequent likelihood evaluation on a second dataset, where data distributions differ.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical aspect of deploying machine learning models in the real world, where data from shifted distributions can occur. Despite numerous algorithmic approaches emerging for OOD detection, there is a lack of theoretical understanding in this area.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a realistic setting studied by researchers where test data may come from unknown classes during training, and good generalization is crucial due to the unavailability and diversity of OOD data. The probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory of OOD detection was proposed as an open problem.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to discern outliers from the intended data distribution, which is vital for ensuring high reliability and a good user experience. Most recent techniques in OOD detection use information from a single representation located in the penultimate layer to determine if an input is anomalous.\nRecognizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for machine learning systems, but most OOD detection methods are based on a single modality (either vision or language), not utilizing the rich information in multi-modal representations.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks usually define one dataset as in-distribution (ID) and all others as OOD, setting impractical goals such as perfect distinction between very similar images from different datasets, which limits the usefulness of these models in real world settings.\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability and safety of deep neural networks in real-world scenarios. Most previous OOD detection methods focus on designing OOD scores or introducing diverse outlier examples to retrain the model.\nDetecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is necessary for machine learning models in critical safety systems. Existing approaches assume access to some OOD samples during training, which may not be available in real-world scenarios."

Researchers have used the impossible space design mechanic to overcome these constraints.\nProfessionals in domains like film, theater, or architecture often use physical models to visualize spaces. With virtual reality (VR), new tools provide immersive experiences with corrected perceptions of depth and scale. Yet, these VR tools lack the tangibility of physical models, which is a gap that using tangible objects in VR could potentially fill. However, this introduces the challenges of producing suitable objects and interacting with them when only the virtual ones are visible.\nLocomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) poses a challenge due to the mismatch between the size of a Virtual Environment and the physically available tracking space. Current research in VR locomotion techniques have not reached a conclusion as yet.\nToday's virtual reality (VR) systems use chaperone rendering techniques to prevent user-object collisions. However, these techniques are limited in their ability to provide advanced compositing between the real and virtual world due to the lack of a detailed geometric model of the real world.\nThe use of vection, the illusion of self-movement, has recently been explored as a novel way to immerse observers in mediated environments without physically moving. This provides advantages over existing systems that employ costly, cumbersome, and potentially hazardous motion platforms, which are often surprisingly inadequate to provide life-like motion experiences.\nVirtual Reality has created a demand for realistic and cheap reconstruction of real-life products. This has raised challenges surrounding the use of consumer-grade scanning devices which often result in objects with seams and misaligned textures.\nVirtual reality (VR) experiences currently require dedicated infrastructure like infrared cameras for tracking, or they provide a limited 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) tracking which compromises the user experience.\nRoom-scale virtual reality games allow natural navigation through physical walking, but physical tracking space is limited.

However, current programming efforts required to produce a VR application are substantially large.\nVirtual reality (VR) aims to replicate physical environments and experiences, which are often mediated by objects and tools, such as controllers. However, a gap exists in comprehending and quantifying the phenomenon of tool embodiment (where the tool becomes an extension of the body) in VR and how different controllers impact this experience.\nRecent studies indicate that women are more susceptible to VR-induced sickness, which could explain the low adoption rate of VR technology among women. Field-of-view (FOV) reduction during locomotion is a widely used strategy to mitigate VR sickness as it inhibits peripheral optical flow perception and reduces visual/vestibular conflict.\nAdvances in tracking technology and wireless headsets enable walking as a means of locomotion in Virtual Reality. However, while exploring large, room-scale virtual environments, it's often desirable to enhance users' perceived walking speed for a more immersive experience.\n4D experiences are one of the most immersive kinds of experiences that current virtual reality technologies can offer. However, the production of 4D contents is still very labor-intensive, preventing the wider spread of 4D platforms.\nRoom-scale Virtual Reality (VR) systems that have arrived in users' homes require locomotion techniques to navigate in larger Virtual Environments (VEs). The most popular technique, point & teleport, does not allow users to select their post-teleport orientation, resulting in manual orientation correction and potential entanglement with the headset cable.\nIn the realm of Virtual Reality (VR), there exists a gap for creating realistic sensations of ground surface deformation while users walk in a VR space.\nThe use of flying and Fish Tank metaphors for viewpoint control are common in virtual reality systems, but they often face issues with scene scaling and object positioning for manipulation in stereoscopic displays.\nLow-cost virtual reality adapters for smartphones have limited input options, mostly relying on head tracking, making complex tasks like navigation difficult.

Existing approaches like Walking-in-Place (WIP) and leaning input using bulky controllers have limitations in navigation efficiency and feasibility in mobile VR contexts.\nIn the realm of Virtual Reality (VR), there exists a gap for creating realistic sensations of ground surface deformation while users walk in a VR space.\nThough electronic music has become mainstream and music production tools are more widely used, there has been limited innovation in these tools' user interfaces, which mainly use a standard 2D interface. However, the advent of high-quality consumer virtual reality (VR) technology has made it possible to develop unique user interfaces that can capitalize on an interactive 3D space.\nThe adoption of real walking in virtual reality (VR) is limited due to the requirement of impractically large amounts of physical space."

Attempts to combine KGE and logical rules have resulted in treating rules as additional KGE constraints or approximating exact logical inference using probabilistic models, but these approaches have scalability issues due to the intractability of the total number of ground rules.\nThe automatic construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured text has resulted in KGs with millions of entities (nodes) and facts (edges). These KGs are sparse in terms of facts known for a given entity, making it difficult to use in real-world applications.\nKnowledge graph (KG) entity typing, which aims at inferring possible missing entity type instances in KG, is a significant but still under-explored subtask of knowledge graph completion.\nKnowledge graphs encapsulate entities and relationships, but the vast amount of information describing an entity could overwhelm users. This has stimulated research on entity summarization, where compact summaries for entities are automatically generated. Various techniques ranging from ranking and mining to machine and deep learning have been proposed, but the continuous improvements have made it challenging for newcomers and the community to stay current.\nTextual corpora, such as financial documents, contain a wealth of knowledge. Knowledge graphs have recently become a popular approach for capturing structured knowledge of entities and their relationships.\nPath queries on a knowledge graph are used to answer compositional questions. However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces, but they suffer from cascading errors when applied recursively to answer path queries.\nQuerying knowledge graphs (KGs) to explore entities and discover facts can be difficult and tedious, even for users with substantial programming or data analytics skills.\nKnowledge graphs, while popular, often suffer from incompleteness due to multiple semantic issues where a relation or an entity can have multiple meanings. This makes multi-hop reasoning, a common method for knowledge graph completion, challenging.\nHuman-curated knowledge graphs are incomplete, necessitating their auto-completion. Prevalent approaches like graph embeddings and textual encoding have drawbacks: embeddings are hardly generalizable to elements not visited in training and are vulnerable to graph incompleteness, while textual encoding has high overheads due to costly scoring and lacks structured knowledge.\nQuerying Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a complex task due to their size and complexity. Traditional approaches of embedding KG units in Euclidean space often fail to capture the hierarchical nature and semantic information of entities in the graph, and they usually only utilize multi-hop queries, ignoring more complex operations like intersection and union of simpler queries.\nWith the large volume of new information created every day, the necessity of determining the validity of information in a knowledge graph and completing its missing parts have become crucial tasks. Researchers have been developing increasingly complex knowledge graph completion methods using low-dimensional graph embeddings.\nKnowledge Graphs are used for integrating data from heterogeneous sources at organizations like JPMorgan Chase (JPMC). A core problem in this field is linking mentions in textual sources to entities in the knowledge graph. Existing techniques cater mainly to entities existing in Wikipedia, proving less effective when applied to bespoke entities within an enterprise.\nLarge knowledge graphs require reasoning for development, especially for completion to infer new triples based on existing ones. Both rules and embeddings can be used for knowledge graph reasoning, each with their own strengths and limitations. Rule-based reasoning is accurate and explainable but suffers from efficiency issues due to huge search space, whereas embedding-based reasoning is scalable and efficient, but struggles with learning good representations for sparse entities due to heavy reliance on data richness.\nExisting knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation methods predominantly focus on advanced neural network architectures for analyzing KG structure. Concurrently, for model learning, these methods rely mostly on Negative Sampling (NS), which is not robust and may lose useful data.\nKnowledge graphs are dynamic, with new facts about an entity being added or removed over time, creating multiple versions of the same graph. The problem of automatically generating a summary of these versions is a long-studied problem, but most methods are limited to pairwise version comparisons, making it challenging to capture a complete evolution of the graph over several versions.\nIn search engines, Knowledge Graphs are used for knowledge discovery. When a user searches for an entity, related entities are usually provided without explanations of how they are related. Existing methods for dealing with large complex relatedness graphs between two related entities have limitations.\nKnowledge graphs are being used for enriching query representations in an entity-aware manner. However, traditional methods often overlook non-entity words and clicked websites in queries that help convey users' intent.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have been used to infer missing facts and entity types based on existing facts. However, there is still a challenge for the inference of fine-grained entity types due to the relatively fewer observed instances of these types present in KGs.\nKnowledge graphs are useful for numerous applications but often suffer from missing relations between entities, leading to the task of knowledge graph completion or relation prediction. Most existing methods focus on maximizing the likelihood of observed instance-level triples and generally do not pay much attention to ontological information such as type information of entities and relations.\nMost prior work in knowledge base (KB) completion has focused on the task of relation extraction. Inferring missing entity type instances in a KB, a critical task for completion, has received little attention."

However, there hasn't been any structured comparison of these tasks to understand their relatedness or a unified approach addressing them.\nThe rise of false information online has been addressed by manual fact-checking and automatic fact-checking methods. However, manual fact-checking is slow and non-scalable while automatic fact-checking lacks explainability and credibility. Recently, the approach of checking whether a given claim has been previously fact-checked has emerged.\nFact-checking is a task requiring considerable effort, and there's a need for real-world data sets that can effectively facilitate natural language processing tasks in this context.\nManually or programmatically verifying a scientific claim by providing supporting or refuting evidence rationales is challenging even for domain experts. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of misinformation on social media or news websites, highlighting the crucial need for an automated fact-verification tool.\nFact-checking in news organizations is an important yet time-consuming and costly process. A model that allows crowdsourced fact-checking with professional oversight and automation is yet to be realized.\nTraditional fact checking methods cannot keep pace with the modern influx of information, necessitating an approach that can computationally verify information.\nAutomated fact-checking on a large scale is difficult due to the noisy document collections like the web or news articles, and comprehensive studies on this task have been scarce.\nFact verification has gained significant attention as a method for tackling misinformation. Current benchmarks focus mostly on textual sources (unstructured information) and have largely ignored structured information, such as tables.\nThe increasing concern with misinformation has stimulated research efforts on automatic fact checking. The FEVER dataset introduced a benchmark fact-verification task, where a system is asked to verify a claim using evidential sentences from Wikipedia documents.\nExisting fact checking datasets do not introduce the complexity of requiring models to extract evidence from multiple hops and sources."

However, existing methods inadequately explore connectivity aspects of knowledge graphs to infer user preferences, particularly with respect to modeling sequential dependencies and holistic semantics of a path.\nKnowledge graphs (KGs), though essential for various applications, may contain incorrect facts due to their automated construction. Detecting and explaining these inconsistencies is a difficult task, especially when dealing with large KGs, because current solutions are either poorly scalable or lack reliability and interpretability.\nKnowledge graphs have been proven effective for interpretable and controllable text generation and exploratory search. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on end-to-end construction of an argumentation knowledge graph that can support argument synthesis, argumentative question answering, or fake news detection.\nThe use of heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KG) as auxiliary information in recommendation systems has greatly progressed, with reasoning over KG paths illuminating the user's decision-making process. Previously, this process has been dealt with as a multi-hop reasoning problem but this approach results in a vast search space that often gives poor accuracy and little explanation diversity.\nKnowledge graphs (KG) have become increasingly important to endow modern recommender systems with the ability to generate traceable reasoning paths to explain the recommendation process. However, previous research rarely considers the faithfulness of the derived explanations to justify the decision making process.\nKnowledge graphs are widely used to improve recommendation accuracy and to reason the recommendations. However, reasoning on paths within knowledge graphs is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Traditional recommendation methods often use brute-force methods to find feasible paths, leading to issues with convergence and explainability.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) maintain facts supported by an underlying schema and are usually accompanied by a confidence score indicating the likelihood of their validity. Despite their popularity, most KGs focus on static data, not incorporating temporal information, and fail to comprehensively manage uncertain data.\nKnowledge graphs (KGs), using triples to describe real-world facts, are widely used in intelligent analysis and applications but may contain noises and conflicts introduced during construction. Currently, tasks or applications based on KGs assume that the knowledge in the KG is completely correct, which can lead to potential deviations.\nGenerating natural language descriptions for knowledge graphs (KG) is an important area in intelligent writing. Recent models for this task replace the sequence encoder in a commonly used encoder-decoder framework with a graph encoder. However, these models suffer from problems such as entity missing and repetition."

However, this approach does not optimize the knowledge description order prediction with data-driven methods.\nPrevious works on knowledge base question answering (KBQA) have used subgraph retrieval for streamlined reasoning. However, these techniques can be either heuristic or intertwined with the reasoning process. This leads to partial subgraph reasoning, causing biases, especially when intermediate supervision is not present.\nCurrent Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) task mainly focuses on performing answer reasoning upon KGs with binary facts and neglects the n-ary facts, which contain more than two entities. Moreover, the multi-hop reasoning framework popular in binary KGQA task is not directly applicable on n-ary KGQA.\nKnowledge graph reasoning is pivotal in many applications, with knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) being two principal reasoning tasks. However, existing works typically consider these two tasks separately using different models or algorithms.\nStructured knowledge grounding (SKG) leverages structured knowledge to complete user requests, but has been limited by the heterogeneous nature of its inputs and outputs, resulting in different SKG tasks being investigated by different communities in isolation.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) are fundamental for search and question answering (QA) tasks, but research on deep or neural-based representation of KGs and deep QA has mostly transitioned to AI, ML, and NLP communities.\nAnswering complex natural language questions on knowledge graphs (KGQA) is a challenging task due to the need for reasoning with the input natural language questions and a massive, incomplete heterogeneous KG. Prior methods obtain an abstract structured query graph/tree from the input question and traverse the KG for answers. However, they cannot deal with missing links in the KG.\nKnowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) involves retrieving entities as answers from a Knowledge Graph (KG) using natural language queries. The challenge lies in learning to reason over KG facts relevant to the question that traverse through KG entities and lead to the question answers. The existing approach decodes the question into instructions used to guide KG traversals, but can lead to reasoning under irrelevant context if they do not exactly match the underlying KG information.\nQuestion answering over temporal knowledge graphs (KGs) efficiently uses facts contained in a temporal KG to answer natural language questions. These questions often present three challenges that previously have not been satisfactorily addressed: questions often do not specify exact timestamps; there are subtle lexical differences in time relations; off-the-shelf temporal KG embeddings previously used disregard the temporal order of timestamps.\nRecent advances in personalized recommendation have sparked great interest in the exploitation of rich structured information provided by knowledge graphs.

Existing methods have primarily focused on overcoming this issue in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which handle grid-based data like images, while largely overlooking graph neural networks (GNNs) that deal with non-grid data.\nContinual learning (CL) is a crucial problem in the field of machine learning, where agents have to learn from a sequentially incoming stream of data, solving new problems over time while retaining previous knowledge. However, existing solutions face challenges of catastrophic forgetting (CF), high memory costs, and lack of theoretical understanding of neural networks' behavior when learning new tasks.\nCatastrophic forgetting in neural networks is a performance issue observed in deep learning models when learning new tasks, leading them to forget previously learned tasks.\nCatastrophic forgetting is a common problem in neural networks, where the network loses information about the first task after being trained on a second task.\nThe catastrophic forgetting problem in neural networks has been a primary focus in continual learning research with many solutions being proposed in the form of new algorithms. However, the underlying properties of such networks that contribute to this forgetting phenomenon are yet not well-understood.\nTraining a comprehensive artificial intelligence capable of multiple tasks is impeded by a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. Replay of all past data can mitigate this problem, but it requires substantial memory and is often unfeasible in real-world scenarios where past data access is limited.\nArtificial neural networks, when learning tasks over time, suffer from a problem known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). This happens when the weights of a network are overwritten during the training of a new task causing forgetting of old information.\nContinual Learning (CL) primarily focuses on Bayesian inference over the parameters of a deep neural network. However, this traditional approach may lead to forgetting the previous tasks over time.\nContinual Learning (CL) entails sequentially learning a set of tasks while preserving acquired knowledge. Existing methods often assume the data stream is explicitly divided into known contexts or tasks which helps in knowledge transfer between contexts. However, in real-world CL scenarios, there may not be clear task or context boundaries, leading to the need for task-agnostic CL."

Furthermore, no public paired real HSI denoising dataset exists to learn HSI denoising network and quantitatively evaluate HSI methods.\nWhile deep learning has greatly improved hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction, current methods have deficiencies. Self-attention networks often compromise internal resolution in an attempt to balance performance and complexity, losing fine-grained, high-resolution features. Existing optimization methods focusing on spatial-spectral domain learning still result in a significant visual discrepancy between the reconstructed HSI and the true image.\nThe advancement of deep learning techniques has enhanced the spatial resolution of hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR), but developing unsupervised deep networks for this task remains a challenge.\nPanchromatic (Pan) and multi-spectral (MS) images provided by satellites have high spatial and high spectral resolutions, respectively.

However, most existing pan-sharpening methods only work in the spatial domain and rarely explore potential solutions in the frequency domain.\nPansharpening, which aims to obtain a high-resolution image by fusing multispectral and panchromatic images, is commonly performed using CNNs with standard convolution operations. Yet, few approaches employ context-adaptive/dynamic convolution, which has shown impressive results in high-level vision tasks.\nExisting pansharpening approaches, which fuse a high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) with a low-resolution hyper-spectral image (LR-HSI) to generate an enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution, neglect using an attention mechanism for transferring HR texture features from PAN to LR-HSI features.

However, existing approaches rely on manual feature engineering and do not allow for end-to-end training.\nKnowledge Graph (KG) embeddings have been critical in predicting missing facts in KGs for knowledge base construction and reasoning. However, existing KG embedding approaches mainly focus on learning and predicting facts within single language-specific KGs, with no effective method of transferring knowledge between multiple KGs due to insufficiency of alignment information and inconsistency of facts.\nKnowledge graphs have become essential for AI-related applications, yet modern ones are far from complete. Existing knowledge graph completion (KGC) models treat the triples in KGs independently, not leveraging the valuable information from the local neighborhood around an entity.\nAlthough many efforts have been made to complete knowledge graphs (KGs) by various graph embedding methods, most only focus on static KGs (SKGs) without considering the time dependency of facts. Existing methods of temporal KGs (TKGs) embedding suffer from two issues: they need to be retrained when a new timestamp appears and they lack a general way to transplant SKG embedding methods to TKGs.\nIn search engines, Knowledge Graphs are used for knowledge discovery. When a user searches for an entity, related entities are usually provided without explanations of how they are related. Existing methods for dealing with large complex relatedness graphs between two related entities have limitations.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have been used to infer missing facts and entity types based on existing facts. However, there is still a challenge for the inference of fine-grained entity types due to the relatively fewer observed instances of these types present in KGs.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) are complex and understanding the relatedness between entities in KGs can be challenging. Querying these KGs can also be complex due to the large and diverse nature of entities.\nThere are concerns regarding Trust, Privacy and Transparency in the use of Knowledge Graph (KG) contents by applications.\nEstimating the node importance in a knowledge graph (KG) is an existing problem, with several methods having already been developed for this task. However, these existing approaches do not fully utilize information available in KGs, or lack flexibility needed to model the complex relationship between entities and their importance.\nKnowledge graphs are used in recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems. However, existing approaches do not account for the varying relationships of users with entities in the knowledge graph, leading to issues with unrelated entities negatively impacting recommendation results.\nKnowledge graph completion is a crucial issue due to its significant contributions to many applications, but current methods have not fully resolved it.\nThe task of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to automatically infer the missing fact information in Knowledge Graph (KG). Current attempts to leverage user-item interaction data for improving KGC may hurt the original performance due to the different intrinsic characteristics of the two kinds of data sources.\nOnline social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn extract and organize knowledge using Knowledge Graphs (KG). However, building KG for social networks poses challenges, such as handling noisy, implicit and multilingual input data and understanding the interaction between the KG and the social network.\nKnowledge graphs are dynamic, with new facts about an entity being added or removed over time, creating multiple versions of the same graph.

Existing WSD systems and methods struggle when applied to specific domains, and the effectiveness of these systems in domain-specific applications is still an open research question.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is traditionally considered an AI-hard problem. A breakthrough in WSD would have a significant impact on many relevant web-based applications, such as information retrieval and information extraction.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a challenging task in the field of natural language processing where diverse sources of evidence and background knowledge are used to determine the correct sense of a word in a specific context.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a central task in the area of Natural Language Processing. Several context-based probabilistic and machine learning methods for WSD have been presented in literature, but a formal analysis of the parameters affecting the performance of these systems is lacking.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an ongoing area of research. Prior to this study, various supervised machine learning algorithms have been applied to WSD, and corpora such as Sem-Cor, Senseval 2 and 3, and others have been used for training these algorithms.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a commonly addressed problem in natural language processing, often solved using external resources or training data.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a crucial task in natural language understanding but rules for disambiguation are generally varied for different words. Most existing works focus on a small set of ambiguous words.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a crucial task in natural language processing, and different methods have been explored to tackle this problem. Task 11 of Semeval 2007 focuses on English lexical sample task for WSD.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an ongoing challenge in Natural Language Processing and current methodologies do not sufficiently exploit domain information.\nPrior Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods have various capabilities and strengths when handling different terms.\nWord Sense Disambiguation, in which words in a text are tagged with a sense label, has been a common practice. However, no study has addressed the variant of this task - Word Domain Disambiguation (WDD), where words are tagged with a domain label.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is traditionally performed within multilingual MT, requiring parallel corpora, wordnets, and sense annotated corpora as resources. However, these resources are typically scarce, and their availability varies significantly across different languages.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a long-standing problem in Natural Language Processing, and the use of anaphoric references as indicators of text topics, as proposed by Boguraev et al., has been recognized.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a common issue in Natural Language Processing and making use of syntactic and semantic features to disambiguate verb senses has proven challenging.\nA common practice in multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) involves using translation equivalents in another language to describe the senses of ambiguous words.

However, many enterprise data management tools, such as SAP ERP, SAS to Tableau, still rely heavily on SQL.\nHadapt, a company commercializing the Yale University research project HadoopDB, aims to maximize performance for processing data warehousing queries over very large datasets without sacrificing fault tolerance and scalability.\nHadoop is being increasingly used in data science workloads, however, there is a lack of understanding from a user-centric perspective about the manner in which data scientists use the system and the extent to which its use  aligns with its design.\nHadoop is a massively scalable parallel computation platform capable of running hundreds of jobs concurrently, and many thousands of jobs per day, which requires a scalable, secure, multi-tenant, and operable workflow management system. Existing workflow management tools are found lacking in at least one of these qualities.\nApache Hive is a widely used data warehouse system for Apache Hadoop. It is used for various big data analytics applications. However, there are several identified shortcomings in Hive's file formats, query planning, and query execution which affect its performance.\nThe Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the common system for handling large datasets but may have inefficiencies.\nApache Hive started as an open-source relational database system primarily designed for batch processing of big data workloads.\nThe Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) is the core memory abstraction behind the popular Apache Spark data-analytic framework. However, there are efficiencies to be found in how datasets relate to one another.\nEnterprises are increasingly using Apache Hadoop, specifically HDFS, as a central repository for all their data from various sources. However, many enterprise data management tools rely on SQL and many users are familiar with it. Therefore, SQL processing over Hadoop data has gained traction, leading to a surge in systems providing such capabilities.\nThe size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is rapidly growing, making traditional warehousing solutions expensive. Hadoop, a popular open-source map-reduce implementation, is used as an alternative, but its programming model is very low level and requires developers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse.\nThere is a growing interest in integrating relational DBMSs and MapReduce systems, but finding a balance, specifically leveraging the superior indexing and query processing power of a relational DBMS for data stored in Hadoop/HDFS, is a technical challenge.\nSpark is a widely used in-memory computing framework in big data applications that accelerates computations by storing data as resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) in main memory. However, main memory space is limited and Spark does not have an intelligent mechanism to optimize RDD storage.\nEnterprises face the challenge of executing analytical queries over large datasets, and while Hadoop has proven to scale well, it struggles with I/O performance. The proposed solutions aiming to improve Hadoop's query performance often make deep modifications in Hadoop or HDFS, limiting their adoption and compatibility with future Hadoop versions.\nThe growth of Hadoop has facilitated a variety of application engines building on the YARN resource management layer, leading to fragmentation and repeated efforts as each engine re-implements basic functional features such as fault-tolerance and security."

These models often fail in difficult scenarios like severe occlusion, ambiguous lanes, and poor light conditions, as learning from a richer context is required.\nVehicle detection plays an important role in traffic control at signalised intersections, and a solution based on vision-based sensors is needed.\nExisting road detection techniques for autonomous navigation can be limited by illumination conditions, requiring day and night capabilities.\nDetecting traversable road areas ahead a moving vehicle is a critical process for autonomous driving systems. Most existing algorithms use color to classify pixels as road or background. These algorithms mitigate the effects of lighting and weather conditions by using different color representations. However, no comparison of these color representations has been performed to date.\nExisting methods for predicting the 3D layout of lanes assume a known, constant lane width or rely on pre-mapped environments, and their performance may be limited due to these assumptions and reliance.\nEstimating 3D properties of a moving or parked vehicle on the road is a critical task for autonomous driving. However, it remains under-researched partially due to the lack of large scale and fully-annotated 3D car databases suitable for research in this area.\nExisting methods for object detection in autonomous vehicles leverage sensor fusion, but they fail in adverse weather conditions where sensor streams can be distorted asymmetrically. These edge-case scenarios are not represented in available datasets, and existing fusion architectures cannot handle them.\nCamera-based lane detection algorithms are crucial for semi-autonomous and fully autonomous systems like self-driving cars. However, the lane detection process is typically encumbered with tedious preprocessing and computational effort.\nSelf-driving cars use multi-camera systems for motion estimation, but extracting the full relative motion including metric scale has been a challenge with existing methods.\nLane detection is commonly approached with a two-step pipeline where a segmentation mask of the lane markings is first predicted, and a lane line model is fitted to the post-processed mask next. This results in suboptimal performance as the parameters of the network are not optimized for the task of estimating the lane curvature parameters but for a proxy task of segmenting lane markings.\nCurrently, existing systems for vehicle counting and trajectory reconstruction at intersections require complex setups and computations.\nAutonomously backing up a vehicle towards a trailer using a self-estimating computer vision system for 3D trailer coupler position alignment is a challenging task that has not been efficiently solved.\nDetecting water bodies such as puddles and flooded areas is a challenging task for autonomous cars. This is because water surfaces are highly refractive, and their appearance can vary significantly depending on the viewing angle, surrounding scene, and weather conditions.\nExisting approaches for lane detection, which are key in advanced driver assistance systems, are categorized as lane area segmentation and lane boundary detection. However, most of these methods do not utilize a large amount of complementary information such as geometric priors, which are discarded in the alternative use of lane area and lane boundaries.\nExisting approaches for multi-sensor multi-object tracking in autonomous driving systems are either unreliable, deriving from a dependency on a single input source, or lack accuracy due to inadequate exploitation of inherent information when fusing results from multiple sensors.\nLane feature extraction is a critical computational step in lane analysis systems.\nIn the context of self-driving, perception through Radar provides complementary information to other sensors such as LiDAR or cameras in the form of Doppler velocity. However, there are challenges in using Radar because of noise and measurement ambiguities, which have been difficult for existing fusion methods.\nOvertaking accidents often occur due to limited visibility, often caused by occlusion from the vehicle in front. With the proliferation of digital cameras in vehicles, there's potential to mitigate these incidences."

Recently, some works frame lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem which needs to group adjacent keypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which results in inefficient and time-consuming post-processing.\nAfter the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge, its dataset and evaluation based on accuracy and F1 score have become the standard to measure the performance of lane detection methods. However, the validity of this evaluation method in down-stream tasks has not been adequately researched.\nExisting road detection techniques for autonomous navigation can be limited by illumination conditions, requiring day and night capabilities.\nVehicle detection plays an important role in traffic control at signalised intersections, and a solution based on vision-based sensors is needed.\nThere's a challenge in bridging domain discrepancy in lane detection among different scenarios to reduce additional annotation and re-training costs for autonomous driving. Conventional methods only focus on pixel-wise loss while ignoring shape and position priors of lanes, which hinders performance improvement of cross-domain lane detection.\nLane detection is a critical method for autonomous systems. Numerous approaches have been presented, however, the challenge is not fully resolved as most techniques either consider lane detection as a dense prediction or a detection task, disregarding the distinctive lane marker topologies."

Traditional methods use generative models to augment training data, but the generative pipelines remain separate from the discriminative re-id learning stages.\nUnsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth labels. Existing methods often rely on estimated pseudo labels via iterative clustering and classification, but they are susceptible to performance penalties incurred by the inaccurate estimated number of clusters.\nExisting person re-identification (Re-ID) methods require all training data in advance, whereas real-world Re-ID data are inherently captured over time or from different locations, requiring a model to incrementally learn from new data without forgetting what it has already learned.\nExisting person re-identification (ReID) methods use hashing algorithms to learn compact binary codes and perform fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, these algorithms need a very long code to achieve high accuracy, which compromises search speed.\nPerson re-identification (re-id) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, but the enormous number of possible triplet data among the large number of training samples makes the training impossible.\nUnsupervised person re-identification (RE-ID) is increasingly being researched due to its potential to address the scalability problem of supervised RE-ID models. However, it is challenging to learn discriminative information without pairwise labels across disjoint camera views.\nPerson re-identification (re-ID) is critical in retrieval processes, where re-ranking is a necessary step for accuracy improvement. However, there is limited effort in the re-ID community to improve re-ranking, especially with fully automatic, unsupervised solutions.\nUnsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) is relevant in real-world systems like public security and intelligent transportation systems, however it's challenged by a data distribution discrepancy across cameras and lack of label information.\nIn person re-identification (re-ID), feature representation through convolutional neural networks is key, although single-path and single-loss networks have limited efficacy due to the learning objective only achieving one of multiple minima.\nPerson re-identification (ReID) is a challenging problem addressed by many metric learning approaches, among which triplet loss is one of the state-of-the-art methods. However, the exploration of the margin between positive and negative pairs of triplets has not been sufficiently addressed.\nDespite the great advances made in person re-identification (ReID) using Convolutional Neural Networks, current ReID models only output a scalar distance between two persons and provide little in the way of a semantic understanding or explanation as to why two individuals are deemed the same or not."

However, existing convergence analysis relies on non-intuitive, impractical, and often opaque conditions and is achieved under strict regularity conditions in limited settings.\nPolicy Optimization (PO) is a widely used approach to address continuous control tasks, but traditional methods do not reuse samples generated by one policy to estimate the performance of other policies.\nPolicy gradient methods are a prevalent class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, and a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient estimator variance. Some recent research has proposed extending the baseline to depend on both the state and action, arguing that it reduces variance and boosts sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates.\nPolicy gradient-based methods used in continuous control are limited by the need for the agent's underlying probability distribution which limits policy representation to parametric distribution classes. This limitation results in local movement in the action space and can lead to the convergence of sub-optimal solutions.\nActor-critic is one of the most popular families of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing works on actor-critic primarily focus on two-timescale updates where the actor and critic are updated in separate steps.\nPolicy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that update by following a performance gradient estimate. Current methodologies use Monte Carlo techniques for this estimation. These methods, however, tend to have high variance and therefore require a large number of samples which leads to slow convergence.\nThe problem of temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning is typically resolved using Q-learning and other algorithms based on the methods of temporal differences (TD(\u03bb)). However, using TD-based algorithms with \u03bb > 0 often allows faster credit propagation, it also involves certain implementational problems such as lack of generality and computational inefficiency.\nThe hierarchical interaction between the actor and critic in actor-critic based reinforcement learning algorithms naturally lends itself to a game-theoretic interpretation, but the usual individual gradient approach may lead to issues with cycling and slower convergence.\nIn reinforcement learning, assuring convergence when using a compact hypothesis class for value function approximation is a lingering issue. The standard temporal-difference learning algorithm converges when the hypothesis class is a linear compilation of fixed basis functions, but may diverge with a non-linear (general) hypothesis class.\nPolicy gradient methods in reinforcement learning update policy parameters by taking steps in the direction of an estimated gradient of policy value. The statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data is a challenging task.\nPolicy gradient methods are among the most effective methods for large-scale reinforcement learning. Their empirical success has prompted several works that develop the foundation of their global convergence theory. However, prior works have either required exact gradients or state-action visitation measure based mini-batch stochastic gradients with a diverging batch size.\nPolicy gradient methods are widely used to solve complex control problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most methods focus on choosing the step size while ignoring the batch size, which is the number of samples used to estimate the gradient direction for each update of the policy parameters.\nPolicy gradient methods have grown in popularity in motor control and robotic applications in the reinforcement learning field over the last decade. These methods have been optimized through effective gradient directions and efficient estimation algorithms. However, little attention has been given to the automatic selection of step size, which greatly influences the convergence properties of policy gradient methods.\nActor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning have been re-popularized due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches tend to fail, such as when function approximation is involved. Additionally, there is a growing body of evidence that phasic dopamine signals-based actor-critic approaches play a key role in biological learning.\nActor-critic (AC) methods have shown great empirical success in reinforcement learning. Despite the well-studied asymptotic convergence of AC under two time-scale learning rate schedules, the non-asymptotic convergence and finite sample complexity of actor-critic methods remain largely unresolved.\nPolicy gradient (PG) reinforcement learning algorithms, despite their strong (local) convergence guarantees, are plagued by a high variance in the estimation of the gradient that limits their learning performance.\nPolicy gradient methods have performed well in solving complex reinforcement learning challenges but still suffer from large variance issues on policy gradient estimation, which leads to poor sample efficiency during training."

Fast approximations using feed-forward neural networks exist, but these usually only accommodate a fixed set of styles and cannot handle arbitrary new styles.\nNeural Style Transfer has shown exciting results for image manipulation, however, there are limitations in controlling spatial location, color information and across spatial scale, as well as issues like applying ground textures to sky regions.\nThe neural style transfer of images has been successfully achieved using a feed-forward network, but the direct extension of processing videos frame by frame often results in flickering outputs.\nRecent efforts in style transfer attempt to incorporate semantic information to achieve better perceptual results, but there is a computation bottleneck with back-propagation which has not been addressed effectively.\nRecent works on style transfer typically need to train image transformation networks for every new style, and the style is encoded in the network parameters by enormous iterations of stochastic gradient descent, which lacks the ability to generalize to new styles in the inference stage.\nExisting style transfer methods often result in common visual artefacts and do not produce a diverse range of stylizations.\nNeural style transfer has drawn broad attention in recent years. However, most existing methods aim to explicitly model the transformation between different styles, and the learned model is thus not generalizable to new styles.\nExisting approaches using feed-forward generative network for multi-style or arbitrary-style transfer often compromise image quality and model flexibility. Additionally, it is fundamentally difficult to achieve comprehensive style modelling using a 1-dimensional style embedding.\nZero-shot artistic style transfer aims at transferring an arbitrary style into content images. The existing methods have a trade-off between generalization and efficiency, which impedes high quality, real-time zero-shot style transfer.\nUnsupervised style transfer, which aims to transfer the style of an example image to a source image, often struggles with the complex notion of image style regarded as a local texture transfer, often coupled with a global color transfer."

Existing works have neglected to address these observations.\nNeural style transfer has significantly advanced for image style transfer. However, consistent style transfer for videos remains a challenging problem, as existing strategies either use substantial video data with optical flows or employ single-frame regularizers, which have limited performance on real videos.\nPrevious single-frame style transfer methods which maintain temporal consistency impose a strong constraint on the whole image, an assumption that can often be violated. There is a need for a versatile style transfer method capable of performing artistic, photo-realistic, and video style transfer jointly, without needing videos during training.\nVideo style transfer, which has numerous applications such as augmented reality and animation production, is gaining attention in the artificial intelligence community. Traditional image style transfer methods face challenges when applied to video, particularly generating satisfactory stylized results for any specified style while maintaining temporal coherence across frames.\nCurrent style transfer methods struggle from a lack of holistic understanding of artistic styles, often using a single image or artist for reference, and relying on direct comparisons within the domain of RGB images or on CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet. These methods can introduce extra biases, as they often lack an in-depth artistic perspective.\nCurrent deep convolutional neural networks can solve the artistic style transfer problem initially proposed by Gatys et al. However, these models lack flexibility in adapting to different tasks or style constraints without undergoing retraining.\nExisting universal style transfer methods based on second-order statistics are either computationally expensive or prone to generate artifacts. These methods face a trade-off between image quality and runtime performance.\nRecent work in style transfer has improved significantly in the representation of color and texture, computational speed, and image resolution. However, the explicit transformation of image content, such as deforming, adding or removing content details, has been mostly neglected.\nPhotorealistic style transfer involves transferring the style of a reference image to another image so the result looks like a likely photo. The existing models are slow due to their large sizes, creating a need for more efficient solutions.\nRecent solutions for photorealistic style transfer that employ deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require intensive training from large-scale datasets, which results in their limited applicability and poor generalization ability to unseen images or styles.\nExisting neural style transfer methods require reference style images to transfer texture information from style images to content images.\nFast Style Transfer methods, which aim to transfer a photograph to an artistic style in real-time, have been trending recently. However, controlling the stroke size in the stylized results remains an open problem.\nNumerous attempts have been made at arbitrary style transfer since the seminal work of Gatys et al. Existing state-of-the-art approaches, however, often generate results that are insufficiently stylized, especially in challenging cases.\nNeural style transfer, an emerging technique endowing images with artistic styles, has succeeded with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for monocular images or videos. However, stereoscopic image style transfer, requiring consistency between views to provide a comfortable visual experience, remains unexplored.\nIn recent years, image-to-image style transfer, including tasks like color and texture transfer, has become a significant focus in neural image processing. However, none of these methods could effectively work with custom filter effects that users apply through different platforms such as Instagram.\nExisting artistic style transfer methods with deep neural networks have significantly improved, but they still suffer from artifacts like disharmonious colors and repetitive patterns."

However, none of them offer a consistent or reliable solution, and this method can potentially eliminate privacy concerns such as in healthcare applications.\nKnowledge distillation is a technique that transfers knowledge from a large, cumbersome teacher model to a smaller student model. Recent results suggest that a student-friendly, pruned teacher model might be more suitable for knowledge transfer.\nKnowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a student network using training data. However, data is not always accessible due to large sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. There have been many attempts to address this issue for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that handle grid data like images and videos, but the problem remains largely overlooked for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which handle non-grid data with differing topology structures within a discrete space, making these CNN-based methods unsuitable for GNNs.\nExisting knowledge distillation frameworks usually focus on getting the student model to mimic the output of the teacher model for every sample and transfer cross-sample relations from the teacher to the student. However, the structured relations at a category level are often overlooked.\nKnowledge distillation addresses model compression by transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller one. Existing approaches focus on aligning sample representations but fail to transfer class representations, leading to potential biases. They also ignore the imperfections of the teacher model.\nRecommender systems have begun to use knowledge distillation, a model compression technique in which a more compact model (the student) is trained with transferred knowledge from a complex model (the teacher). Existing methods rely on unidirectional distillation, with the assumption that the teacher is always superior to the student.\nTeacher-student knowledge distillation is a widely used technique for compressing large language models into smaller sizes suitable for low-latency applications. The quality of the student model depends on both the teacher model and the choice of transfer set used for distillation. However, there's a difference between the generic corpora used for pretraining the teacher model and the domain-specific corpora of downstream tasks.\nCross-modal knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a model trained with superior modalities (Teacher) to another model trained with weaker modalities (Student). However, existing approaches require paired training examples in both modalities, and getting data from superior modalities may not always be feasible.\nDistillation with unlabeled examples is a popular method for training deep neural networks when the amount of labeled data is limited. A large 'teacher' neural network is trained on labeled data, which is then used to generate labels on an unlabeled dataset, which are then used to train a smaller 'student' model. The success of this approach depends on the quality of the teacher's labels, as the student could get confused if trained on inaccurate data.\nExisting knowledge distillation methods focus on baseline settings, where teacher models and training strategies are not as strong and advanced as state-of-the-art approaches"

Coping with high workload is a significant challenge and is a topic of active discussion across major conferences.\nEvaluating the quality of research work is critical in the scientific process.

This discontent has led to the desire for new forms of publications to increase inclusivity, accessibility, and pedagogical strength.\nMost computer science conferences rely on paper bidding to assign reviewers to papers.

A critical function most NLP systems need is to correctly identify biological entity terms and link them to respective database records, known as biological named entity tagging.\nMost Natural Language Processing (NLP) datasets are manually labeled, which leads to issues such as inconsistent labeling or limited size.\nRecent developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are heading towards knowledge rich resources and technology. Integration of linguistically sound grammars, sophisticated machine learning settings and world knowledge background is made possible due to resources like deep multilingual treebanks, and world knowledge information encoded within ontologies and Linked Open Data datasets (LOD).\nThe notion of 'in-domain data' in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is often vague as textual data varies in nuanced linguistic aspects such as topic, style, or level of formality. Moreover, domain labels are often not available, making it challenging to build domain-specific systems.\nUndergraduate students can benefit from learning how natural language processing (NLP) relates to their understanding of formal natural language structures. However, resources that allow these students to interact with NLP visualizations and models may not be readily accessible or inclusive.\nNovice writers often struggle with composition, and creating effective composition support tools requires a deep understanding of the writing process and products. Existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques face significant challenges in handling the variety of texts produced by middle school students.\nUnfamiliar terminology and complex language can present barriers to understanding science. Considering this, natural language processing can help address these issues by automatically defining unfamiliar terms.\nIn NLP research, the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging to assess the quality of data.\nState-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models analyze the meaning and similarity of texts to perform tasks such as paraphrase identification, document retrieval, response suggestion, and extractive summarization.\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen significant growth, with an increase in publications and applications in a variety of products. However, the field has not realized its full potential due to certain practices.\nNatural language processing (NLP) tools often exhibit a decrease in performance when applied to data that is linguistically different from the corpus used during development, posing challenges for developing NLP tools for domains lacking annotated corpora.\nThe Whiteboard project was initiated to integrate deep and shallow natural language processing components to take advantage of their synergies. This was done to increase robustness, guide the search space, and reduce processing time.\nEmpirical natural language processing (NLP) systems in application domains involve interoperation among multiple components, ranging from data ingestion, human annotation, to text retrieval, analysis, generation, and visualization.\nThere is a lack of large-scale, open, community-based language resources for natural language processing (NLP), with existing resources having data from limited genres."
