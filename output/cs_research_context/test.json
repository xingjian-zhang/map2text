                "content": "Predict new context based on these contexts: Most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) depend on the homophily assumption and fail to generalize to graphs with heterophily where dissimilar nodes connect. Traditional concepts of homophily or heterophily are global measurements of the whole graph and fail to describe the local connectivity of a node.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a neural architecture to learn vector representations of nodes and graphs. However, GNNs have only been evaluated empirically, not theoretically, and have not been compared to traditional methods such as the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic (1-WL).\nDespite the recent success of Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs), their strong inductive bias of homophily limits their ability to generalize to heterophilic graphs and leads to the over-smoothing problem. Current works attempt to mitigate this issue by emphasizing the contribution from similar neighbors and reducing those from dissimilar ones when performing aggregation, but these techniques fail to optimally utilize dissimilarities.\nQuestion answering on complex tables is a challenge due to the relationships between tables and columns, which can be modeled as graph. Current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) ignore the relationships of sibling nodes and use summation as aggregation function to model parent-child nodes. This often sees nodes with less degree, like column nodes in schema graph, obtaining little information.\nExisting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are largely modeled by the Uniform Message Passing framework, which simplifies homophily and heterophily to the node-level property and ignores attribute differences. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't account for the diverse characteristics of different attributes.\nIn the fraud graph, fraudsters often interact with a large number of benign entities to hide themselves, thereby forming both homophilic and heterophilic connections. Existing GNN-based fraud detection methods enhance the homophily in fraud graph and use the low-pass filter to retain the commonality of node features among neighbors, disregarding the heterophilic connections.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are key models in many applications, but the majority of these models assume homophily among nodes in a graph. This assumption overlooks the case of heterophily, where most connected nodes belong to different classes.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) and message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to be effective for subgraph structures, but existing message passing mechanics are not well-designed theoretically, especially when it comes to targeting explicit edge modeling applications like subgraph isomorphism counting and matching.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) use the same aggregation methods and parameters across all nodes in a graph, enabling them to handle homophily relational data. However, difficulties arise when not all graphs are homophilic and when distributions within the same graph vary significantly. Moreover, existing GNNs integrate node features and structure identically, which limits their expressive power.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) like GCN and GPRGNN, while effective in graph machine learning, are vulnerable to homophily changes on test graphs and have limited capacity to generalize to graphs with different homophily levels. Existing methods to improve GNN robustness, which learn new graph structures or calculate edge attentions, are mostly spatial and involve complex defense mechanisms.\nGraph kernels, widely used for graph classification tasks, suffer from limited performance due to hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. Graph neural networks (GNNs), which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in downstream graph-related tasks, have some limitations and can't exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm in graph isomorphism tests.\nThe computational superiority of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) entails a iterative aggregation scheme, which introduces redundant message flows and hinders the propagation of long-length path information and learning of graph similarities.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known for their ability to distinguish the isomorphism class of their inputs. However, the degree of difficulty to accomplish this task in the message-passing model (MPNN), which represents most GNNs in use today, is not well understood.\nFriend recommendation services are essential for the growth of online social networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as LightGCN and PPRGo, have shown superior performance due to their ability to encode neighborhood context. However, many GNN variants use a static, pre-defined normalizer which doesn't fully leverage the potential of GNN and leads to scale distortion.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle with limited expressive power, long-range interactions, and lack a principled way to model higher-order structures. The recently proposed Message Passing Simplicial Networks attempt to address these issues but are constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure of Simplicial Complexes (SCs).\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for learning on graph-structured data. They typically rely on message passing mechanisms for propagation, but little effort has been made to discover and analyze the relationships among different propagation mechanisms.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend basic Neural Networks (NNs) by using graph structures based on the relational inductive bias (homophily assumption). However, GNNs have been found performing unsatisfactorily on a non-trivial set of datasets when compared to NNs, a fact attributed to heterophily.\nMost graph neural network (GNN) architectures work by message-passing node vector embeddings over the adjacency matrix and it is assumed that they are able to capture the graph topology efficiently.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs), regardless of their specific structure, should be either invariant (the ordering of the input graph's nodes does not affect the output) or equivariant (a permutation of the input permutes the output). A recent work by Maron et al. (2019) proved the universality of invariant GNNs when higher-order tensorization is allowed inside the network.\nThe most popular design of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is 1-hop message passing, where information is aggregated from 1-hop neighbors. Although 1-hop message passing's expressive power is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, researchers extended it to K-hop message passing, which has remained unanalyzed."
