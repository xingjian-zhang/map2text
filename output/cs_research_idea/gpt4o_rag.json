A multi-head quantum attention mechanism is used to include semantic similarity information of nodes into the model.\nThe study presents a novel approach named Hierarchical Intention Embedding Network (HIEN), which integrates attribute dependencies through bottom-up tree aggregation in the constructed attribute graph, and simultaneously captures user and item intents for different item attributes with a hierarchically attentive mechanism.\nThe authors propose a novel Multi-Granularity Semantic Aware Graph model (MGSAG) that incorporates both fine-grained and coarse-grained semantic features without considering distance limitations.

It leverages deep generative models and a novel attention mechanism.\nThe authors propose the first model, called HIT, specifically designed for higher-order pattern prediction in temporal hypergraphs.

RPC introduces relative parameters to regularize the objective for boundedness and low variance, and unlike prior approaches, does not use logarithm and exponential score functions.\nThe study proposes a theoretical argument that the representation matrix learned by contrastive learning boosts robustness through two properties: one prominent singular value for each sub-class in the data and a large alignment between the prominent singular vectors and the clean labels of each sub-class.\nThe authors propose a unifying framework for learning contrastive representations of stochastic processes (CReSP) that does not require exact reconstruction.\nIn this study, a detailed analysis of the feature learning process of contrastive learning is presented, focusing on two types of features: semantically aligned sparse features to learn from, and dense features to avoid. A principle called feature decoupling is also introduced.\nThe study proposes a novel way to leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate target feature learning, with an online pseudo labeling scheme with refinement that significantly reduces noise in pseudo labels. They execute the contrastive learning task simultaneously with pseudo labeling, following a scheme similar to MoCo but with a source-initialized encoder.\nThis paper presents a general method that mitigates these two problems by considering where and what to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. It proposes learning different augmentation invariances at varying depths of the model and expanding the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to lessen the misleading effects of strong data augmentations.\nThe paper proposes a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Learning (SPCL) loss for the ERC task, which uses the Prototypical Network to address the imbalanced classification problem through contrastive learning, without requiring a large batch size.\nA class-contrastive framework is proposed for explaining deep neural networks. This framework seeks to identify features with class-discriminative power, answering the question 'why is the input classified into this class, but not others?'.\nA contrastive learning approach is proposed where the neural network identifies the divergence of patterns in MWPs.

This is achieved by training a teacher model to produce consistent cluster assignments between different views of the same image while a student model mimics the prediction of the self-supervised teacher.\nThe authors propose an innovative adversarial-based mutual learning network (AMLN) that introduces process-driven learning for online knowledge distillation in addition to the traditional outcome-driven learning.\nTo improve performance on hard samples, a novel Distribution Distillation Loss is proposed that seeks to bridge the performance gap between easy and hard samples, and is generic for various types of facial variations."

This method employs a unique sampling strategy that involves iterative drawing of positives, recording of minimum distances to unlabeled examples, and removal of nearest unlabeled space.\nThe authors propose a selection of filtering techniques to handle the issue of noise in LBD systems, two of which leverage the LBD system itself rather than relying on statistical or manual examination of document collections."

                "content": "Predict new key_idea based on these key_ideas: The authors propose to resurrect sigmoid in deep learning by achieving dynamical isometry through orthogonal weight initialization in deep nonlinear networks, countering the prevalent use of ReLU networks.\nThe authors propose the idea of achieving successful deep learning with significantly fewer learnable parameters adapting to the target function, from an approximation perspective. They theorize that a ReLU network with a small number of intrinsic parameters can approximate any Lipschitz continuous function with an exponentially small error.\nThe authors propose a new approach called 'Analytic Marching', which uses the fact that a ReLU-based MLP creates linear regions in its input space. From these regions, the authors identify analytic cells and faces associated with the zero-level isosurface of the implicit function.\nThe authors propose the idea that there can be convergence to low robust training loss for neural networks of polynomial width under natural assumptions, using the ReLU activation function.\nThe authors propose to estimate the parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using a gradient descent algorithm combined with median- or trimmed mean-based filters to mitigate the effect of the arbitrary outliers.\nThe authors model the optimization of a ReLU network using a geometric and combinatoric object known as a zonotope, leading to an analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal loss to perturbations of the training data and new insights into zonotope vertex selection relevance to optimization.\nThe paper identifies natural settings where depth 2 ReLU networks trained with gradient flow are provably non-robust, even when robust networks that classify the training dataset correctly exist.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to global optimality, and they establish new lower bounds on the size needed to approximate a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. They also construct a family of functions that scale exponentially with dimension.\nThis paper shows that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is limited by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. This limit, surprisingly, is independent of the depth of the network.\nThe researchers propose a study to prove that one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU networks of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can achieve competitive classification accuracy, even when data is corrupted by adversarial label noise.\nThe authors propose that the traditional requirement for each neural network layer to be larger than the previous can be replaced with a constant expansivity assumption, opposed to an exponential one. They also introduce the concept of 'pseudo-Lipschitzness'.\nThe authors proposed a training method using stochastic gradient descent for two-layer ReLU neural networks that demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks under specific conditions of separability in the RKHS induced by the infinite-width network.\nThis paper proposes a parametric framework named k-ReLU, which jointly approximates the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer. This allows the method to encapsulate dependencies between the inputs of different ReLUs, thus overcoming the convex barrier of single neuron relaxation.\nThe authors propose a novel methodology that applies a localized change in the function space for repairing ReLU networks. This methodology constructs a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which corrects the behavior on the buggy input when combined with the original network.\nThe authors propose that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.\nThis work aims to characterize the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the $L^p$ functions, using networks with the ReLU activation functions, and also examines the same with an additional threshold activation function and networks with general activation functions.\nThe authors propose a new efficient method for the verification of ReLU-based neural networks that uses dependency relations between the ReLU nodes, to prune the search tree that needs to be considered by MILP-based formulations of the verification problem.\nThe authors counter the belief in exponentially increasing length distortion with network depth by proving the expected length distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU networks with standard random initialization.\nThis research expands upon previous work by examining the effects of small perturbations of input vectors leading to large changes in outputs in ReLU networks of constant depth and a large range of widths, emphasizing the importance of bottleneck layers and arguing that these networks tend to compute functions that are locally very similar to random linear functions.\nThe authors propose fast algorithms and robust software for the convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. They reformulate the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set of group-l1-regularized data-local models under polyhedral cone constraints."

The adversarial perturbations are only added to the salient regions and are ensured to be the same within each superpixel.\nThe authors propose a novel bi-level optimization algorithm that robustifies images to adversarial perturbations by finding points within the vicinity of natural images.\nThe authors propose cascade adversarial training which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks. They also propose a unified embedding space for classification and pixel-level similarity learning to disregard unknown pixel level perturbations.\nThe study proposes an image-based adversarial attack method specifically designed for medical images, which includes a loss deviation term to increase the divergence between the CNN prediction and its ground truth label, and a loss stabilization term to ensure similar CNN predictions for the example and its smoothed input.\nThe paper aims to create physically feasible adversarial attacks against visual tracking in real scenes with a universal patch to camouflage single object trackers. The authors propose a maximum textural discrepancy (MTD), a loss function that seeks to maximize the de-matching of the features between the search image and templates.\nThe paper introduces the Object-Based Diverse Input (ODI) method, which creates adversarial images on 3D objects and ensures the rendered image to be classified as the target class. The ODI method effectively increases input diversity by leveraging multiple source objects and randomizing viewing conditions.\nThis paper addresses this issue by using a targeted adversarial attack in the restoration process, in order to enhance the performance of object detection post-restoration. The authors introduce an ADAM-like adversarial attack to generate pseudo ground truth for restoration training.\nThis paper proposes a novel clone detection approach, Adversarial Clone Detection (ACD), which mimics the adversarial process between plagiarists and detectors. It is designed to build a robust clone detectector and also to model the behavior of plagiarists.\nThe authors propose a novel algorithm that can anonymize selected attributes in an image that a user does not wish to share, without compromising the visual quality of the images. The algorithm uses adversarial perturbation to embed imperceptible noise that leads to incorrect classification of the chosen attributes while preserving identity information and visual content.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to process images, leveraging on the model's robustness and adversarial attacks' object location agnosticity to match natural image statistics, effectively defending against adversarial manipulations.\nThe authors propose the use of adversarial examples for both images and questions as augmented data, which does not alter the visual properties in the image or the semantic meaning of the question, therefore, maintaining the correctness of the image-question-answer triplet."

The authors propose to learn a shared latent space on a unit hyper-sphere where the latent distributions of visual features and semantic attributes are aligned class-wise and then use class centers and boundaries to separate unseen from seen samples.\nThis paper proposes ODIN, an open source error diagnosis framework for object detection and instance segmentation that allows model developers to add meta-annotations to their data sets, compute performance metrics split by meta-annotation values, and visualize diagnosis reports.\nThe authors propose a new few-shot learning method, OOD-MAML, which can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples and perform classification tasks using an extension of model-agnostic meta learning. This method begins by synthesizing fake OOD samples, which resemble in-distribution samples and uses them along with real samples for learning a model initialization and initial fake sample across tasks.\nThe authors propose a deep multi-class data description, termed as Deep-MCDD, which is intended to be effective in detecting OOD samples and classifying in-distribution (ID) samples. Unlike the softmax classifier, Deep-MCDD aims to find a spherical decision boundary for each class to determine whether a test sample belongs to the class or not by using class-conditional distributions that are modeled as separable Gaussian distributions.\nThe authors propose an OOD detection algorithm which comprises of an ensemble of classifiers that are trained in a self-supervised manner. Each classifier is trained by leaving out a random subset of training data as OOD data and the remaining as in-distribution (ID) data.\nThe authors propose a novel technique that relies on self-supervision for generalizable out-of-distribution (OOD) feature learning and rejection of such samples during inference time, without the need to pre-know the distribution of targeted OOD samples or incurring extra overheads compared to other methods.\nThe authors propose modifications to a popular method, ODIN, introducing two strategies that remove the need for tuning with OoD data, and improving the performance of OoD detection.\nThe authors propose a two-head deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that maximizes the discrepancy between two classifiers to detect OOD inputs. They train a two-head CNN with one shared feature extractor and two classifiers, each with different decision boundaries but able to classify in-distribution (ID) samples correctly.\nThe authors propose a unified framework for OOD detection that uses an energy score, which better distinguish in- and out-of-distribution samples than softmax scores because they are theoretically aligned with the probability density of the inputs and less susceptible to overconfidence.\nThe authors present a series of tests including a variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation techniques to determine whether they can identify out-of-distribution (OOD) patients."

A technique for accurately identifying contingent regions and exploiting this knowledge to improve features for value function approximation is proposed.\nThis paper introduces RouLette, an intelligent engine for multi-query execution that overcomes the shortcomings of previous work-sharing strategies through runtime adaptation, using reinforcement learning to switch between exploration and exploitation of opportunities.\nThe authors propose an innovative perspective on transfer learning in RL: the ability to assign credit can reveal structural invariants in tasks that can be transferred to make RL more sample efficient.\nThe authors present the first Reinforcement Learning gym framework that emulates the collective behavior of neurons in the brain and identifies suppression parameters for synthetic degenerate models of neurons.\nThe authors propose using common sense knowledge for decision making in an adventure game, particularly to shape the reward structure of the environment for reinforcement learning agents.\nThe authors propose hierarchical guidance, a framework that leverages the hierarchical structure of the problem to integrate different modes of expert interaction and can incorporate various combinations of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) at different levels.\nThe paper proposes new reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by neurological evidence, particularly the role of the basal ganglia and frontal cortex in mammalian reinforcement learning.\nTo tackle these challenges, the authors propose an approach involving deep neural network controllers that operate directly on raw state features provided by the game engine. Additionally, they present a new heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm that combines direct exploration in the policy space with backpropagation.\nThe authors propose a framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to address both the problem of learning object-related behavior and selecting primitive actions in action games.\nThe authors posit that many aspects of animal learning and performance can be described using simple reinforcement learning models that utilize dynamic control of meta-parameters.\nThe authors propose the challenge of rapid task-solving in novel environments, for which they introduce two new challenge domains, Memory & Planning Game and One-Shot StreetLearn Navigation, and develop Episodic Planning Networks (EPNs) to enhance deep RL agents' abilities.\nThe paper introduces GoalRec, a model-based reinforcement learning framework. It utilizes a uniquely designed disentangled universal value function for item recommendation that can adjust to various goals, disentangling environmental dynamics and high-variance reward signals.\nThe authors propose a novel learning paradigm, Self-Imitation via Reduction (SIR), to solve compositional reinforcement learning problems which operates based on the concepts of task reduction (solving a hard task by actively reducing it to an easier task) and self-imitation (imitating the self-generated solution trajectory).\nThe authors propose a new perspective on reinforcement learning with a focus on motivational systems. They suggest that in many cases, animals choose whether to execute a single response rather than choosing between different actions.\nThe authors suggest a method that allows an RL agent to generalize for a target game using training from a source game in the Atari 2600 environment. This learning approach updates the model using multiple RL agents trained in parallel with different representations of the target game.

Unlike BERT, they construct six pre-training tasks trained on both general and financial domain corpora to capture language knowledge and semantic information better.\nThe authors propose to extend BERT to a new model, StructBERT, which further incorporates language structures into pre-training to achieve a more nuanced understanding of language.\nThe paper chooses RoBERTa as the pre-trained model for Subtask 1 and uses graph building from news datasets. For Subtask2, XLM-RoBERTa is chosen as the pre-trained model and adopts adapted threshold, Bi-LSTM, LEAM, LaSO approaches to handle the data unbalance problem and to extract more abundant semantic information.\nThe paper introduces Pseudo-Token BERT (PTBERT), a semantics-aware contrastive learning framework for sentence embeddings that exploits the pseudotoken space (i.e., latent semantic space) representation of a sentence while eliminating the impact of superficial features such as sentence length and syntax.\nThis paper examines the reproducibility of results and claims from four recent BERT-based metrics, with a special focus on the impact of preprocessing.\nThe authors propose MarkedBERT, a modified version of the popular pre-trained BERT model. MarkedBERT integrates exact match signals, which have been proven valuable for deep IR models, using a marking technique with marker tokens that highlight exact matched query-document terms.\nThe authors present CodeBERT, a bimodal pre-trained model for both programming language and natural language, trained with a hybrid objective function employing replaced token detection to support downstream NL-PL applications.\nThe authors propose a multi-task generalized linear model using BERT features to quickly improve the quality of test item difficulty estimates. This model allows comparison of test-taker proficiency, item difficulty, and language proficiency frameworks, enabling new item difficulty estimates without prior piloting.\nThe authors introduce ConfliBERT, a domain-specific pre-trained language model for conflict and political violence, which is built using two approaches: pre-training from scratch and continual pretraining.\nThe authors introduce RareBERT, an extension of the BERT model that is tailored for rare disease diagnosis and trained on administrative claims datasets. This model includes context embedding and temporal reference embedding, and features a novel adaptive loss function to handle class imbalance.\nThe authors propose Constrained BART (CBART) for lexically constrained text generation.

The approach identifies the parameter space where long-lasting attack effects on parameters reside and disrupts that space during local learning.\nThis work is the first to study the risk of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures, highlighting a potential vulnerability in which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) upon which the model is trained has a cascading effect on multiple data values.\nThis study presents a novel equivalence between Byzantine gradient attacks, where workers report arbitrary gradients, and data poisoning, a scenario where input data is altered maliciously by workers.\nThe study examines a security threat to RL, where an attacker poisons the environment to force the agent to execute a specific policy chosen by the attacker, either by manipulating rewards or transition dynamics in a stealthy manner.\nIn this paper, the authors investigate a new type of data poisoning exploitation that increases the risk of privacy leakage of benign training samples. They focus on amplifying and exposing the membership of targeted classes through two proposed attacks: a generic dirty-label attack for supervised classification algorithms and an optimization-based clean-label attack in transfer learning scenarios.\nThe study proposes migrating backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explores the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation.\nThe authors suggest that poisoning attacks introduce localized high-loss regions, and thereby propose a two-component approach to alleviate these sharp loss regions. This approach involves the use of an optimized friendly noise to maximally perturb examples without degrading performance, and a randomly varying noise component."

Instead of representing a probability distribution function of returns, they propose to represent their characteristic function, which is the Fourier transform of their distribution.\nThis paper investigates off-policy learning when the training data comes from multiple historical policies, proposing that policies, such as neural networks, can be learned directly from multi-logger data with counterfactual estimators.\nThe authors introduce a non-parametric policy gradient approach, NPPG, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods. The key strategy is the use of Friedmann's gradient boosting, where policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models built in a stage-wise optimization.\nThe authors introduce a new method for representation discovery in RL using basis adaptation, by developing a framework for basis adaptation as nonlinear separable least-squares value function approximation utilizing Frechet gradients.\nThe authors propose a model-free algorithm that backpropagates a local quadratic time-dependent Q-Function, which permits the policy update to be derived in closed form."

Additionally, an algorithm is proposed to perform an online adjustment to the weight between the labeled real data and the generated data.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it.\nThe authors propose a new adversarial training approach for robustness over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nThe authors suggest a connection between the adversarial robustness of a model and the number of tasks it is trained on, proposing that models trained on multiple tasks at once can be more robust to adversarial attacks on individual tasks.\nThe authors propose adversarial domain augmentation as a novel solution for the OOD generalization problem. The technique involves using adversarial training to create 'fictitious' yet 'challenging' populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees.\nThe authors propose a novel robust adversarial training approach that dynamically generates adversarial examples based on currently model's parameters and uses them for further training in an iterative schedule to improve the robustness of MRC models.\nTo tackle the vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks, the authors propose Ensemble Adversarial Training, a methodology that enriches training data with perturbations transferred from other models.\nThe authors propose adversarial post-specialization, a new method of specializing the full distributional vocabulary, that exploits words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global specialization function, combining standard L2-distance loss with adversarial loss for more realistic output vectors.\nThe authors focus on promoting adversarial robustness in MAML and proposed a general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework which can use unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning.\nThis study analyses the perturbation on the input of the generator and its influence on the generated images, and proposes a smooth generator that investigates the tolerable input perturbation.\nThe authors point out that standard adversarial training methods that focus on fickle adversarial examples can make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples. Toward this, they propose Balanced Adversarial Training, incorporating contrastive learning to increase robustness against both types of adversarial examples.\nIn this work, larger bounds for adversarial robustness are explored, specifically against perturbations that may be perceptible but do not change human predictions. A novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), is proposed to align the network's predictions with an Oracle during adversarial training.\nThe study proposes a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. This method aims to improve model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and teaches models to make predictions based on significant words. It also addresses the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms.\nThe authors propose a model-agnostic method that generates adversarially sampled data based on the few support samples, and fine-tunes the embedding space of a base classifier in a manner that increases the classification margins of these adversarial samples, making the classifier more robust.\nThe authors propose a regularization method that involves generating adversarial examples by perturbing the word embedding matrix of the model and performing contrastive learning on clean and adversarial examples to teach the model to learn noise-invariant representations.\nThe authors develop a theoretical model to analyze how adversarial training aids transfer learning and propose that adversarial training in the source data generates provably better representations, increasing the accuracy of the target data predictor when fine-tuned on this representation.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThe authors find that adversarially robust models, although less accurate overall, outperform traditionally-trained models when used for transfer learning."

In this approach, a smaller student model learns to rank items from both the training data and the guidance of a larger teacher model.\nThe authors extend the idea of knowledge distillation by allowing the training of a student model that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, taking advantage of not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher for better training and final performance.\nThe authors propose a novel training policy called Long Short-Term Sample Distillation that leverages both long-term and short-term teaching signals from previous training phases. The long-term signal provides guidance and teacher\u2013student differences while the short-term signal provides up-to-date cues for better updates.\nThe paper presents a model distillation method, referred to as 'structural model distillation', which allows memory reduction without needing to redesign the architecture; the method uses a student architecture that is a simple transformation of the teacher architecture and can use the same hyperparameters.\nThe authors propose a new method of knowledge distillation from the perspective of curriculum learning by the teacher's routing, which they term route constrained optimization (RCO). Rather than supervising the student model with a converged teacher model, it is supervised with anchor points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed by.\nThe researchers propose a novel KD method that overcomes existing limitations by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and training a student model to mimic this flow.\nThe authors introduce Distill-and-Compare, a novel method for auditing black-box models which does not require probing the black-box model API or pre-defining features to audit. It uses the black-box models as 'teachers' to train transparent 'student' models, which are then compared to understand the black-box model's functioning.\nThe authors propose an adversarial imitation based knowledge distillation approach to acquire knowledge from raw sentences for event detection, without the need for external toolkits. This utilizes a teacher module to learn knowledge representations from ground-truth annotations, and a student module to imitate the teacher, integrating knowledge distillation into the feature-encoding stage.\nThe paper questions the common premise that larger and more accurate models always make better teachers, and investigates the factors affecting the performance of knowledge distillation.\nThe authors propose three hypotheses explaining the success of knowledge distillation: it enables DNNs to learn more visual concepts than learning from raw data, it ensures that the DNN learns various visual concepts simultaneously rather than sequentially unlike when learning from raw data, and it provides more stable optimization directions than learning from raw data.\nThis paper explores the working mechanisms of knowledge distillation by studying the case of linear and deep linear classifiers and introduces three key factors (data geometry, optimization bias, and strong monotonicity) that determine the success of distillation.\nThis paper introduces a scenario where knowledge from a cross-task teacher \u2014 with non-overlapping label spaces \u2014 is reused to facilitate the learning of a student model. The approach, called RElationship FacIlitated Local cLassifiEr Distillation (ReFilled), emphasizes the comparison ability between instances as an essential factor threading knowledge across domains.\nThe authors propose a novel training strategy, Views Knowledge Distillation (VKD), which facilitates the transfer of superior knowledge that arises from multiple views depicting the target object within a teacher-student framework.\nThe paper proposes a new perspective on knowledge distillation based on decision boundaries, arguing that transferring information closely related to the decision boundary can be a good approach.\nThe authors propose a novel method to address the problem of large model size and long inference time by applying knowledge distillation together with the distillation of a semantic relation preserving matrix derived from the teacher\u2019s feature encoding.\nThe authors propose Dense Cross-layer Mutual-distillation (DCM), an improved two-way KT method where the teacher and student networks are trained collaboratively from scratch. The authors introduce well-design auxiliary classifiers to certain hidden layers of both teacher and student networks to augment knowledge representation learning and introduce dense bidirectional KD operations between the layers appended with classifiers to boost KT performance.\nThe authors propose KDCL, an efficient online knowledge distillation method that treats all DNNs as 'students' and collaboratively trains them in a single stage, allowing for knowledge to be transferred among students during collaborative training."

Furthermore, the authors present OSCAR, a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model to facilitate the understanding of programs.\nThe authors propose further extensions to LM-BFF, namely LM-BFF-MS, which includes prompts with multiple demonstrations based on automatic generation of multiple label words, and soft demonstration memory which consists of multiple sequences of globally shared word embeddings for a similar context.\nThe authors propose UniCRS, a unified CRS model, based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning. This approach combines the recommendation and conversation subtasks into the prompt learning paradigm, using knowledge-enhanced prompts based on a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM).\nThis study proposes a multi-stage prompting approach that leverages the inherent knowledge stored in the pretrained LM and its generation ability. The approach uses the pretrained language model to generate knowledge based on the dialogue context and then prompt it further to generate responses from the previously generated knowledge.\nThe authors introduced the idea of 0-shot prompts that outperform few-shot prompts in the GPT-3 model. They propose a broader theory of prompt programming that utilizes narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions, and deconstructs a problem into components before delivering a verdict.\nThe authors propose a novel method called Prompt-based Transfer Generative (PTG) for text generation in a transferable setting. PTG first learns a set of source prompts for various source generation tasks and then transfers these prompts as target prompts for target generation tasks."
