The authors propose attacks that generate poisoned gradients for manipulated malicious users to upload based on two strategies: random approximation and hard user mining.\nThe authors discover that backdoor neurons are exposed by their pre-activation distributions, where populations from benign data and poisoned data show significantly different moments, a property that is attack invariant.\nThis paper focuses on data poisoning attacks against crowdsourcing systems that use the Dawid-Skene model, and proposes an intelligent attack mechanism which maximizes the attack utility while disguising the attacking behaviors.\nThe authors propose a new strategy for textual backdoor attacks that does not require an external trigger and ensures that poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The basis of this strategy is the creation of clean-labeled examples, the labels of which are correct but can cause test label changes when combined with the training set.\nThe paper introduces a $handcrafted$ attack that directly manipulates a model's weights. This direct modification gives the attacker more freedom compared to poisoning, and can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.\nThis paper proposes a method for detecting backdoors in neural networks, assuming no prior knowledge about whether a model is poisoned or access to a clean sample set. It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThe paper explores the possibility of model poisoning for backdoor attacks by leveraging the rarely utilized word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and introduces a new method specific to federated learning called Gradient Ensemble.\nThe authors propose a scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks. They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThis paper demonstrates the feasibility of a targeted attack on black-box NMT systems by poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data.\nThis paper proposes a practical data poisoning attack approach, LOKI, against blackbox recommendation systems under the general next-item recommendation setting. LOKI uses reinforcement learning to train an attack agent who generates user behavior samples for data poisoning, interacting with a recommender simulator to bypass the high cost of retraining models and user-interaction frequency restrictions.\nA stronger weight-poisoning attack method is proposed. This method introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper undetectable backdoors with a combinatorial trigger.\nThe authors propose two new types of data poisoning attacks where an adversary intentionally targets the system's fairness. The attacks are known as the anchoring attack and the influence attack on fairness, targeting fairness measures by skewing the decision boundary or maximizing the covariance between sensitive attributes and decision outcome respectively.\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attacks that attempt to evade traditional detection methods.\nThe authors introduce a model-based reinforcement learning framework that can orchestrate untargeted poisoning attacks against federated learning systems by approximating the distribution of the clients' aggregated data.\nThe authors propose adversarial poisoning training (APT) which simulates the poisoning process by introducing fake users known as ERM users dedicated to minimizing empirical risk, in order to build a robust system.\nThis paper introduces Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that increases the durability of backdoors in Federated Learning systems by attacking parameters that are less frequently altered during training.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable.

Data sieving is a proposed method for dataset-efficient training, reducing costs by using only a partial dataset throughout the entire training process.\nThe authors propose a novel pruning method called Fairness-aware GRAdient Pruning mEthod (FairGRAPE) that minimizes the disproportionate impacts of pruning on different sub-groups by calculating the per-group importance of each model weight and selecting a subset of weights that maintain the relative between-group total importance in pruning.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors introduce a block pruning approach to create models that are both small and fast. The approach extends structured methods by considering blocks of any size and integrates this structure into the movement pruning paradigm for fine-tuning.\nThe authors propose a novel pruning method to further optimize the trade-off between efficiency and restoration accuracy by determining the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer.\nThe authors argue that the order in which pruning is carried out has significant impacts on model pruning. To this end, they propose a new approach to determining which layers should be pruned at each step, employing a long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the hierarchical characteristics of a network and generate a pruning decision for each layer."

This network learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings representing point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets.\n\"DeepVoxels\" is proposed as a solution, a persisting 3D feature embedding that encodes the view-dependent appearance of a 3D scene without having to directly model its geometry.\nThe authors introduce a 3D rotation invariant framework for point cloud recognition based on spherical symmetry, utilizing regular icosahedral lattice and its fractals to approximate and discretize sphere, which facilitates easy implementation of convolution to process 3D points.\nThe authors propose a novel end-to-end deep scene flow model, called PointPWC-Net, that directly processes 3D point cloud scenes with large motions in a coarse-to-fine fashion. They also introduce new cost volume, upsampling, and warping layers to efficiently handle 3D point cloud data.\nThe authors introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture that uses random point sampling and a novel local feature aggregation module to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds.\nThe authors propose a novel resolution-free point clouds sampling network that optimizes non-learning-based initial sampled points into improved positions. This network directly samples the original point cloud at different resolutions.\nA unified framework is proposed to streamline neural architectures for 3D point clouds, with the main innovation being the factorization of neural networks into a series of view transforms and neural layers. This enables a fair comparison of existing work and exploration of new designs.\nThe key idea is the 3DNN (3D Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm, which matches an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint of the image. It also automatically generates detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image and transfers information across images to label and segment objects in a scene.\nA deep learning architecture is presented which introduces grouping techniques to define point neighborhoods in the initial world space and the learned feature space. Additionally, dedicated loss functions, namely the pairwise distance loss and the centroid loss, are incorporated to further structure the learned point feature space.\nThis paper proposes an algorithm for analysis of pointwise robustness of neural networks that operate on 3D data.\nThe researchers propose a novel system, PointLIE, an approach to adaptive point cloud sampling and recovery. The system unifies point cloud sampling and upsampling into a single framework through bi-directional learning, encoding neighboring offsets of sampled points into a latent space."

They also hypothesise that sensitivity to unseen inputs in neural networks maybe associated to multiple factors, which are amplified by the curse of dimensionality.\nThe authors introduce Unknown-Oriented Learning (UOL), a novel framework for OSDA, consisting of three stages: true unknown excavation, false unknown suppression, and known alignment. The UOL aims to better represent the complicated distribution of the unknown category by excavating diverse semantic information.\nThe paper introduces a new approach for OOD generalization by performing analogy-making and indirection in the functional space. To implement this, they propose FINE (Functional Indirection Neural Estimator), a framework that composes functions to map data input to output on-the-fly.\nThe authors propose ReAct \u2014 a simple and effective technique for reducing model overconfidence on OOD data, motivated by novel analysis on internal activations of neural networks that show distinctive signature patterns for OOD distributions.\nThe authors propose a novel, self-supervised approach for novelty detection that does not rely on pre-defined OOD data. This method evaluates the Mahalanobis distance of the gradients between the in-distribution and OOD data, and is assisted by a self-supervised binary classifier to guide the label selection to generate the gradients and maximize the Mahalanobis distance.\nThe paper analyzes overconfidence and classifies it into two perspectives: over-confident OOD and in-domain (IND). It then proposes a novel reassigned contrastive learning (RCL) to discriminate IND intents for over-confident OOD and an adaptive class-dependent local threshold mechanism for overconfident IND.\nThe authors formalize the OOD generalization problem as constrained optimization, called Disentanglement-constrained Domain Generalization (DDG). DDG aims to learn representations of semantic concepts that are invariant to nuisance factors and generalizable across domains.\nThe authors draw a link between OOD performance and model calibration, posing that multi-domain calibration represents an invariant representation leading to improved OOD generalization. They suggest multi-domain calibration as a measurable and trainable surrogate for the OOD performance of a classifier.\nThe authors propose interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD), a new OCC model that employs a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. This model distinguishes training samples based on their distances to the Gaussian center and the standard deviation of these distances.\nThis paper proposes an adaptive soft pseudo labeling (ASoul) method that estimates soft labels for pseudo OOD samples when training OOD detectors. The method uses an embedding graph to capture semantic connections between pseudo OOD samples and IND intents.\nThe main idea of this research is to mitigate the simplicity bias and improve OOD generalization by training a group of similar models to fit data in multiple ways. They achieve this through the use of a penalty on the alignment of models' input gradients. By doing so, this induces the learning of more complex predictive patterns.\nThe authors propose a principled and practical method for OoD detection with deep hybrid models (DHMs), which model the joint density of features and labels with a single forward pass. It factorizes the joint density into three sources of uncertainty.\nThe authors propose a new theoretical probabilistic framework for OOD detection in deep classification networks which uses two regularization constraints designed to calibrate and estimate sample density to identify OOD.\nThe authors propose a two-step procedure for improving OoD detection. Firstly, they introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on OoD samples, utilizing COCO dataset samples as OoD proxy. Secondly, they introduce 'meta classification' to discard false positive OoD samples by applying linear models to hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities.\nThis paper investigates the potential reasons for the mixed performance results associated with using CAD for OOD generalization. It suggests that even though features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust, it might prevent the model from learning other robust features, and CAD could reinforce existing spurious correlations in the data.\nThe paper proposes a generalized OOD detection method that is independent of out-of-distribution datasets, relying on self-supervised feature learning of the training samples, where the embeddings lie on a compact low-dimensional space.\nThe research concludes that this unexpected behavior of DGMs should be attributed to model misestimation rather than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions of interest.\nThe authors introduce a framework named E^3Outlier, designed for UOD that leverages a discriminative deep neural network (DNN) for better representation learning, using surrogate supervision to create multiple pseudo classes from original unlabelled data. It employs a new approach known as inlier priority, which prioritizes minimizing inliers' loss, to enable end-to-end UOD by discriminative DNN.\nThe authors introduce a new OOD score, called a locally most powerful Bayesian test (LMPBT), that is designed to maximize the probability of correctly detecting OOD samples under specified conditions.\nThe authors formulate two problems associated with graph data -- debiased learning and OOD detection, and propose a unified probabilistic model to tackle them, which includes modeling the graph's generative process and an additional latent environment variable as an indicator."

A cascade classifier is designed to efficiently detect adversarials.\nThe authors propose a unique and practical mechanism for detection of model piracy by uniquely characterizing the profile of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model's decision boundary through its Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs).\nThe authors propose to explain adversarial attacks by estimating the contributions of different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the Shapley value, and they introduce a method to quantify interactions among adversarial perturbation pixels and decompose the entire perturbation map into relatively independent components.\nThe underperformance of conventional attacks is due to sub-optimal attack procedures, as they do not leverage the full representation capabilities of ViTs. This paper introduces two novel strategies to improve the transferability of existing attacks: a Self-Ensemble method for finding multiple discriminative pathways and a Token Refinement approach to enhance discriminative capacity at each ViT block.\nThe authors introduce a three-stage pipeline consisting of resized-diverse-inputs (RDIM), diversity-ensemble (DEM), and region fitting to generate transferable adversarial examples. They also explore the internal relationship between existing attacks and propose RDIM and DEM to exploit this relationship.\nThe authors propose looking at the success of both adversarial attacks and deep steganography tasks from a Fourier perspective, attributing their effectiveness to DNN's sensitivity to high-frequency content. They also introduce two new UAP variants: high-pass UAP (HP-UAP) and Universal Secret Adversarial Perturbation (USAP).\nThe paper offers a comprehensive survey on universal adversarial attacks, focusing on UAP against deep classifiers. It covers the recent progression of universal adversarial attacks, studying the challenges from both attacker and defender perspectives, the reasons behind UAP existence, and also includes universal attacks beyond deep classification.\nThe authors propose a descriptor-based adversarial de-biasing approach called 'Protected Attribute Suppression System (PASS)'. PASS can be trained using descriptors from any previously trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously reduce the encoding of sensitive attributes, which eliminates the need for end-to-end training.\nThe authors suggest enhancing deep neural networks with a small 'detector' subnetwork. This subnetwork is trained for binary classification, identifying genuine data from data with adversarial perturbations."

A principle called feature decoupling is also introduced.\nThe study proposes a novel way to leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate target feature learning, with an online pseudo labeling scheme with refinement that significantly reduces noise in pseudo labels. They execute the contrastive learning task simultaneously with pseudo labeling, following a scheme similar to MoCo but with a source-initialized encoder.\nThis paper presents a general method that mitigates these two problems by considering where and what to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. It proposes learning different augmentation invariances at varying depths of the model and expanding the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to lessen the misleading effects of strong data augmentations.\nThe paper proposes a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Learning (SPCL) loss for the ERC task, which uses the Prototypical Network to address the imbalanced classification problem through contrastive learning, without requiring a large batch size.\nA class-contrastive framework is proposed for explaining deep neural networks. This framework seeks to identify features with class-discriminative power, answering the question 'why is the input classified into this class, but not others?'.\nA contrastive learning approach is proposed where the neural network identifies the divergence of patterns in MWPs.

This framework manipulates only source examples within domain adaptation algorithms and does so in a way that is unnoticeable, indirect, and invisible, thus aiming to degrade prediction performance on the target domain by maximizing label-informed domain discrepancy.\nThe paper proposes an efficient model-targeted poisoning attack against convex machine learning models, which comes with provable convergence to any attainable target model specified by an adversary.\nThe authors present a unified framework for backdoor attacks in 3D; specifically, they design two attack methods: poison-label attacks and clean-label attacks, motivated by recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples, and the proposed feature disentanglement method.\nThe authors propose DEFEAT, a novel and stealthy backdoor attack method that poisons clean data using adaptive imperceptible perturbation and restricts latent representation during the training process to enhance stealthiness and resistance to defense algorithms.\nThe paper proposes a new protocol for assessing the behavior of template update systems against zero-effort attacks, which depend on the ratio of impostor samples included.\nThe study proposes an attribute inference attack against extracted BERT models to illustrate the potential privacy leakage that can happen even when victim models utilize advanced defensive strategies.\nThe authors propose a new threat model that involves minimally altering the shared model architecture in a malicious manner. This allows the server to directly extract a verbatim copy of user data from the gradient updates, bypassing the need to solve difficult inverse problems.\nThe authors propose a black-box backdoor detection (B3D) method, which can identify backdoor attacks with only query access to the model. Along with detection, they also introduce a method for reliable predictions using the identified backdoored models.\nThis paper presents algebraic and hybrid algebraic/learning-based attacks on large-scale natural language models in a grey-box setting, which targets models with a pre-trained (public) encoder and a single (private) classification layer.\nThe authors investigate the code security of machine learning systems, focusing on how nucleus sampling can unintentionally leak texts typed by users, as the series of nucleus sizes for many natural English word sequences can serve as unique fingerprints.\nThe study introduces the concept of contamination attacks that are stealthy and capable of compromising the model's integrity in multi-party machine learning context where the local data remains private.\nThe authors reveal a threat where an adversary can implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by altering the training process. They propose a few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes a feature loss and the standard tracking loss alternately.\nThe authors introduce a novel strategy to generate high-quality fake user profiles under a black-box setting by leveraging publicly accessible items' attribute information (knowledge graph). They propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) which uses deep reinforcement learning techniques.\nThis work presents a version of a ModIvA attack by extracting 'canaries' or unique identifiable pieces of information inserted in NLU training data, aimed to test the model's data security."

The focus is on understanding alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies.\nThe authors propose a coverage-focused method for word alignment that better models consistency and is more closely correlated with machine translation. They introduce an objective that aims to maximize both alignment model score and coverage.\nThe authors propose a task of disambiguating symbolic expressions in informal STEM documents into their precise semantics and abstract syntax tree using a neural machine translation approach.\nA novel approach of word packing is introduced where consecutive words are packed together if they are believed to correspond to a single word in the target language, simplifying the task of automatic word alignment. This method uses the word aligner itself, performed by bootstrapping on its output.\nThe authors propose a novel approach to combining different word alignments by treating word alignment as a pattern classification problem. They adorn alignment links with linguistic features and use a neural network model to learn from individual alignment systems.\nThe paper focuses on determining which method out of syntax based and alignment based is better for a certain set of reviews. It also proposes a combination of syntactic patterns with an alignment model via a partially supervised framework."

The authors propose an Interpolative Distillation (InterD) framework, which interpolates the biased and unbiased models at the user-item pair level by distilling a student model.\nThe authors propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework called Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB) which rearranges sequential sampling to constrain half of each mini-batch to coincide with the previous and subsequent iterations thereby guiding training stability and consistency.\nThe authors propose a new method for KD where only a limited number of unlabeled training samples and a black-box teacher are at disposal. The core idea is to generate a diverse set of out-of-distribution synthetic images using MixUp and a conditional variational auto-encoder to expand the training dataset.\nThe authors propose a comprehensive, interventional distillation (CID) method that captures both sample and class representations while removing bias through causal intervention. The softened logits, typically used as training targets, are considered as context information to eliminate biased knowledge.\nTSPipe, a pipelined approach, is proposed to accelerate the training process of any teacher-student frameworks including Knowledge distillation (KD) and self-supervised learning (SSL). The main idea involves scheduling the computation of the teacher and student network separately, and fully utilizing the GPU during training by interleaving the computations of the two networks and relaxing their dependencies.\nThe authors suggest combining low precision numerics and knowledge distillation - a method they call 'Apprentice' - to improve the performance of low precision networks.\nThe authors developed a two-phase pipeline leveraging self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization ability of CNNs for image classification. The first phase involves learning a teacher model through self-supervised learning, and the second phase is distilling the representations into a student model and fine-tuning the model for the image classification task.\nThe authors propose the adaptive sample weighting to KD, called Prime-Aware Adaptive Distillation (PAD) that incorporates uncertainty learning. PAD is able to identify prime samples in distillation and adjust their effect adaptively.\nThe authors propose a novel framework named Safe Distillation Box (SDB) which protects the intellectual property of pre-trained models by allowing inference ability to all users but restricting knowledge distillation to only authorized users.\nThe authors present a new method called Peer Collaborative Learning for online knowledge distillation, which combines online ensembling and network collaboration into a singular framework. It creates a multi-branch network for training where each branch is considered a 'peer'. The strategy also uses random augmentation multiple times on the inputs to peers to improve knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that utilizes Mixup, a data augmentation technique. MixKD enables the student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model not only on original training examples but also on linear interpolations of example pairs.\nThe authors propose a new distillation strategy for unsupervised learning called BINGO (Bag of InstaNces aGgregatiOn). The method emphasizes the importance of relationships among similar samples and aims to transfer these relationships, learned by the teacher model, to the student model.\nThis paper proposes an innovative self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge between distorted versions of the same training data. This mechanism is designed to bypass the need for accompanying models, instead focusing on learning consistent global feature distributions and posterior distributions across these distorted versions.\nTheir approach introduces a self-supervised learning algorithm where a soft similarity is used for negative images rather than a binary distinction. Using iterative similarity distillation, a slowly evolving teacher model is distilled to the student model by transferring the similarity of a query image to random images.\nThis paper proposes an online knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge of both class probabilities and the feature map using the adversarial training framework.\nThe authors propose a new training procedure for multi-exit architectures based on the principle of knowledge distillation, which encourages early exits to match the probability outputs of later, more accurate exits.\nThe authors propose Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-distillation (S2SD), an extension to DML, that leverages knowledge distillation from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces during training while maintaining test-time cost.\nThe authors propose a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) that blends the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one.\nThe authors propose a method to distill knowledge from a deep pose regressor network by using teacher loss as a confidence score, and assigning variable importance to the teacher prediction. This knowledge transfer is achieved through Attentive Imitation Loss (AIL) and Attentive Hint Training (AHT)."

They propose to first learn on-policy about the data-generating behavior, and then bootstrap an off-policy value estimate on this policy, constructing a value estimate that is partially off-policy.\nThe authors propose a unified perspective to better understand policy optimization methods. This perspective re-expresses the underlying updates in terms of a limited choice of gradient form and scaling function, offering a parameterized space of approximate gradient updates for policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel approach called constraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO) that operates differently from many popular SRL algorithms. CRPO alternates between improving objectives and satisfying constraints during policy updates.\nThis paper introduces the Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an 'optimistic version' of the policy gradient direction, to address the issue of incorporating exploration in policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel policy optimization method called Constrained Update Projection (CUP), which provides rigorous safety guarantees. CUP is developed using newly proposed surrogate functions and performance bounds.\nThe authors introduce a non-parametric policy gradient approach, NPPG, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods. The key strategy is the use of Friedmann's gradient boosting, where policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models built in a stage-wise optimization.\nThis paper proposes a meta-algorithm for the statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data.\nThe authors propose that the state value baseline allows on-policy stochastic natural policy gradient (NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an O(1/t) rate and argue against the commonly believed idea that the primary function of baselines is to reduce variance of the natural policy gradient estimates.\nThe authors present Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization (TEPO), a new formalism for policy optimization, that generalizes previous works by incorporating Taylor expansions.\nThe paper introduces a method for stabilizing policy optimization when off-policy data is being reused. This involves the inclusion of a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that is generating the data and the current policy, which assures small and safe updates with off-policy data.\nConstrained Policy Optimization (CPO), a new general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning, is proposed. The algorithm has guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration and allows for training neural network policies for high-dimensional control while ensuring safety throughout training.\nThe paper proposes a mechanism to interpolate between a direct value estimate and a projected value estimate, computed from the reward and previous estimates. This approach reduces the need to learn about discontinuities, and thus potentially improves value function approximation.\nThe authors propose a fully decentralized and sample-efficient stochastic policy extragradient algorithm for solving tabular zero-sum Markov games, which uses multiple stochastic estimators to estimate the value functions involved in the stochastic updates and employs entropy regularization to boost convergence.\nThis paper proposes the concept of Characteristic Value Function (CVF), the frequency domain representation of the probability distribution of returns in reinforcement learning. Instead of representing a probability distribution function of returns, they propose to represent their characteristic function, which is the Fourier transform of their distribution.\nThe authors propose a method called Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) that can model the advantage function directly from on-policy data, minimizing the variance of the return, without necessitating the (action-)value function.\nIn view of the success of ensemble methods in supervised learning on accuracy and generalization, the authors propose a new method: Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which employs ensemble policies in an end-to-end fashion. EPPO notably integrates each policy with the policy ensemble and optimizes both together, and employs a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space to improve generalization to unseen states and encourage exploration.\nThe authors introduce Constrained Offline Policy Optimization (COPO), an offline policy optimization algorithm built upon a novel offline cost-projection method. This is designed to improve the state-of-the-art in offline constrained policy optimization by explicitly considering distributional shifts.\nThe authors propose a new method called Value Function Factorization with Variable Agent Sub-Teams (VAST) that approximates a factorization for sub-teams, which can be defined in arbitrary ways and vary over time to adapt to different situations, thereby offering a more focused and compact input representation of the original VFF operator.\nThis paper introduces a Bayesian framework that employs approximate posterior distributions to model the uncertainty of the value function in reinforcement learning, using Wasserstein barycenters to propagate uncertainty across state-action pairs.\nThe authors propose a novel policy gradient-style robust optimization approach, PG-BROIL, that balances expected performance and risk by optimizing a soft-robust objective. This is the first policy optimization algorithm that is robust to a distribution of reward hypotheses and can scale to continuous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)."

They identify that good global performance does not translate to improved personalization and propose decomposing the network into a 'body' (extractor) and a 'head' (classifier) to address this issue.\nThe paper proposes PartialFed, a novel approach where instead of loading the entire model as in most previous works, only a subset of the global model\u2019s parameters are loaded.\nThis paper presents FedX, an unsupervised federated learning framework that learns unbiased representation from decentralized and heterogeneous local data. It operates using a two-sided knowledge distillation approach with contrastive learning as a core component.\nThe authors propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (FairVFL) that learns unified and fair representations of data samples based on decentralized features in a privacy-preserving manner. The method involves local data representation learning and uses adversarial learning to remove bias inherited from the data.\nThe authors propose a novel federated learning framework that decouples a model's dual duties with two prediction tasks: one is trained as a generic predictor that is robust to non-identical class distributions across clients while the other is a lightweight adaptive module that is trained as a personalized predictor to minimize each client's empirical risk.\nThe authors propose a new framework, Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS), for training with only positive labels in a federated learning setting.

Consequently, they suggest a novel and privacy-preserving Federated Learning method for handling heterogeneous and long-tail data via Classifier Re-Training with Federated Features (CReFF).\nThe authors propose a novel method of federated learning where each client federates with other relevant clients to obtain a stronger model per client-specific objectives. This is achieved using optimal weighted model combinations for each client, determined by calculating how much one client can benefit from another's model.\nThe authors propose Compressed Vertical Federated Learning (C-VFL), a method for communication-efficient training on vertically partitioned data where a server and multiple parties train a model on their respective features utilizing several local iterations and sharing compressed intermediate results periodically.\nThe authors propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions. This helps decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL.\nThe authors propose 'FedSoft', a soft clustered federated learning approach which allows each local dataset to follow a mixture of multiple source distributions. This model not only trains personalized models but also high-quality cluster models in this setting.\nThe authors put forward a personalized federated learning framework, Local Calibration (LC-Fed), which leverages inter-site inconsistencies at both feature and prediction levels to enhance the segmentation process. The framework uses contrastive site embedding with channel selection operation to calibrate features and a disagreement-aware map to adjust the prediction.\nProposing a federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client, allowing many local updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation.\nAn unsupervised federated learning technique, Orchestra, is proposed. Orchestra exploits the federation\u2019s hierarchy to orchestrate a distributed clustering task and enforce a globally consistent partitioning of clients\u2019 data into discriminable clusters."

They theorize that a ReLU network with a small number of intrinsic parameters can approximate any Lipschitz continuous function with an exponentially small error.\nThe authors propose a new approach called 'Analytic Marching', which uses the fact that a ReLU-based MLP creates linear regions in its input space. From these regions, the authors identify analytic cells and faces associated with the zero-level isosurface of the implicit function.\nThe authors propose the idea that there can be convergence to low robust training loss for neural networks of polynomial width under natural assumptions, using the ReLU activation function.\nThe authors propose to estimate the parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using a gradient descent algorithm combined with median- or trimmed mean-based filters to mitigate the effect of the arbitrary outliers.\nThe authors model the optimization of a ReLU network using a geometric and combinatoric object known as a zonotope, leading to an analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal loss to perturbations of the training data and new insights into zonotope vertex selection relevance to optimization.\nThe paper identifies natural settings where depth 2 ReLU networks trained with gradient flow are provably non-robust, even when robust networks that classify the training dataset correctly exist.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to global optimality, and they establish new lower bounds on the size needed to approximate a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. They also construct a family of functions that scale exponentially with dimension.\nThis paper shows that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is limited by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. This limit, surprisingly, is independent of the depth of the network.\nThe researchers propose a study to prove that one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU networks of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can achieve competitive classification accuracy, even when data is corrupted by adversarial label noise.\nThe authors propose that the traditional requirement for each neural network layer to be larger than the previous can be replaced with a constant expansivity assumption, opposed to an exponential one. They also introduce the concept of 'pseudo-Lipschitzness'.\nThe authors proposed a training method using stochastic gradient descent for two-layer ReLU neural networks that demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks under specific conditions of separability in the RKHS induced by the infinite-width network.\nThis paper proposes a parametric framework named k-ReLU, which jointly approximates the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer. This allows the method to encapsulate dependencies between the inputs of different ReLUs, thus overcoming the convex barrier of single neuron relaxation.\nThe authors propose a novel methodology that applies a localized change in the function space for repairing ReLU networks. This methodology constructs a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which corrects the behavior on the buggy input when combined with the original network.\nThe authors propose that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.\nThis work aims to characterize the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the $L^p$ functions, using networks with the ReLU activation functions, and also examines the same with an additional threshold activation function and networks with general activation functions.\nThe authors propose a new efficient method for the verification of ReLU-based neural networks that uses dependency relations between the ReLU nodes, to prune the search tree that needs to be considered by MILP-based formulations of the verification problem.\nThe authors counter the belief in exponentially increasing length distortion with network depth by proving the expected length distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU networks with standard random initialization.\nThis research expands upon previous work by examining the effects of small perturbations of input vectors leading to large changes in outputs in ReLU networks of constant depth and a large range of widths, emphasizing the importance of bottleneck layers and arguing that these networks tend to compute functions that are locally very similar to random linear functions.\nThe authors propose fast algorithms and robust software for the convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions.

This is achieved by decomposing a sample into its VAE reconstruction and the residual, perturbing the reconstruction in the VAE's bottleneck space, and then adding it back to the original residual as an augmentation.\nThe authors discover that images contain intrinsic structure that enables the reversal of many adversarial attacks; modifying the attacked image to restore the natural structure can serve as a defense against these adversarial threats.\nThe authors propose the first robust superpixel-guided attentional adversarial attack method. The adversarial perturbations are only added to the salient regions and are ensured to be the same within each superpixel.\nThe authors propose a novel bi-level optimization algorithm that robustifies images to adversarial perturbations by finding points within the vicinity of natural images.\nThe authors propose cascade adversarial training which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks.

The ODI method effectively increases input diversity by leveraging multiple source objects and randomizing viewing conditions.\nThis paper addresses this issue by using a targeted adversarial attack in the restoration process, in order to enhance the performance of object detection post-restoration.

This method introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper undetectable backdoors with a combinatorial trigger.\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attacks that attempt to evade traditional detection methods.\nThe authors develop a new data poisoning attack that allows an adversary to control model predictions whenever a desired trigger phrase is present in the input.\nThe authors propose a scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks. They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the gradients of regular and malicious data on the model.\nThis paper introduces Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that increases the durability of backdoors in Federated Learning systems by attacking parameters that are less frequently altered during training.\nThe paper introduces a $handcrafted$ attack that directly manipulates a model's weights. This direct modification gives the attacker more freedom compared to poisoning, and can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.\nThe authors propose a new strategy for textual backdoor attacks that does not require an external trigger and ensures that poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The basis of this strategy is the creation of clean-labeled examples, the labels of which are correct but can cause test label changes when combined with the training set.\nThe authors propose a poisoning attack, where a malicious adversary uses a small poisoned sample of monolingual text inserted into the training set to induce specific, targeted translation behavior like propagating misinformation.\nThis paper proposes a method for detecting backdoors in neural networks, assuming no prior knowledge about whether a model is poisoned or access to a clean sample set. It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe authors propose a new Model Poisoning Attack based on Fake clients (MPAF), where the attacker injects fake clients into a federated learning system and sends carefully crafted fake local model updates to the cloud server during training, such that the learned global model has low accuracy for many indiscriminate test inputs.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThis paper presents a new type of stealthy backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon; reflection. This results in the creation of 'reflection backdoor' (Refool), where reflections are planted as backdoors into a victim model.\nThe authors propose adversarial poisoning training (APT) which simulates the poisoning process by introducing fake users known as ERM users dedicated to minimizing empirical risk, in order to build a robust system.\nThis paper proposes a novel deep hidden backdoor (DeHiB) attack for SSL-based systems which feeds malicious unlabeled training data to the semi-supervised learner, enabling the SSL model to output premeditated results.\nThe study aims to design new attack methods targeting deep learning-based recommender models in federated learning scenarios. The authors propose attacks that generate poisoned gradients for manipulated malicious users to upload based on two strategies: random approximation and hard user mining.\nThe authors present a 'backdoor poisoning' attack on NLP models which utilizes a conditional adversarially regularized autoencoder (CARA) to generate poisoned training samples by poison injection in latent space.\nThis paper demonstrates the feasibility of a targeted attack on black-box NMT systems by poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data.\nThe authors propose a novel threat assessment framework called the Distributed Backdoor Attack (DBA) that exploits the distributed nature of FL. Rather than embedding the same global trigger across all parties, DBA decomposes a global trigger pattern into separate local patterns and embeds them into the training set of different adversarial parties.\nThe authors propose the first backdoor attack (BA) against PC classifiers, which doesn't require knowledge of the victim classifier. The proposed BA involves inserting a cluster of points into a PC as a robust backdoor pattern."

This is achieved by clustering the irregularly distributed weights into structured blocks via reordering the input/output dimension, and then structurally pruning them.\nTo improve the efficiency of network pruning, the authors propose entropy-based pruning, a new regularizer that can be integrated into existing network pruning algorithms. This approach, based on the insight that reducing the information entropy of the network outputs decreases the upper bound of the subsequent decoding search space, could address the slowdown caused by conventional pruning methods.\nThe paper intends to investigate the usefulness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms to alleviate the sparsity problem in CAVR, which is a relatively unexplored area.\nThe authors propose a framework for understanding the internal dynamics of continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures.\nThis paper challenges conventional beliefs by checking several recent unstructured pruning methods and finding that some of these methods hardly use the training data and modifying the preserved weights per layer randomly does not influence the final results.\nThe authors propose Movement Pruning, an adaptive, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more suited to fine-tuning pretrained models.\nThis paper bridges the gap between the model interpretability of sparse convolutional models and the empirical performance of deep neural networks. It does this by incorporating differentiable optimization layers defined from convolutional sparse coding as substitutes for standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural networks.\nThe authors proposed DiSparse, a simple, effective, and first-of-its-kind multitask pruning and sparse training scheme that considers each task independently for disentangling the importance measurement and takes unanimous decisions among all tasks when performing parameter pruning and selection.\nThe authors argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. They formulate pruning as an optimization problem, casting the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and maximizing the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions.\nThe authors examine structured pruning on multilingual pre-trained language models, considering different settings, algorithms, and efficiency aspects, and present Dynamic Sparsification, an approach that allows training the model once and adapting to different model sizes at inference.\nThe authors introduce a network pruning based meta-learning approach with the aim of reducing overfitting by explicitly controlling the network capacity.\nThe paper introduces ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to derive a highly sparse network from an existing dense network. The Heaviside function is chosen due to its practical application in design optimization which also deals with material distribution as a discrete value optimization problem.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors propose a new method that combines the benefits of both pre-training and post-training pruning. This method prunes as early as possible during training without affecting performance. The method uses initial dense training to guide the architecture, constantly evaluates dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking, and introduces an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) to trigger pruning when the architecture stabilizes.\nThe paper proposes a method called Prospect Pruning (ProsPr) that overcomes the limitation of existing methods by using meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. It integrates an estimate of the higher-order effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network.\nThe authors introduce a deep learning inference optimization pipeline which consists of model compression methods like Tensor Decomposition, Graph Adaptive Pruning, Intrinsic Sparse Structures in Long Short-Term Memory, Knowledge Distillation, and low-bit model quantization.\nThe authors propose two operations, pruning and growing, that exploit the discovered sparsity of PC structures. Pruning removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression, and growing increases model capacity by expanding the size of the latent space.\nIn this paper, the authors propose a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. This method creates an initial population, then uses genetic operators to generate new networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible."

A policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is used to train the model.\nThe authors propose leveraging discourse structure to formulate a monotone (non-decreasing) sub-modular scoring function to generate more comprehensible summaries.\nThe study introduces a full-scale multimodal dataset for summarization that gathers documents, summaries, images, captions, videos, audios, transcripts, and titles in English from CNN and Daily Mail. A baseline model is also developed, which employs a newly proposed Jump-Attention mechanism based on transcripts.\nThe authors put forward an improved approach to extractive summarization featuring integrated random walk on a graph constructed based on topical/lexical relations. They also model intra-speaker topics by partially sharing topics from the same speaker in the graph.\nThe paper introduces MDSWriter, a new open-source annotation tool specifically designed for multi-document summarization corpus creation. This tool uniquely structures the complex summarization task into multiple steps for better efficiency.\nThe authors propose a novel multi-document summarization framework, SgSum, which treats source documents as a relation graph of sentences, formulating the task as a sub-graph selection problem. Instead of selecting individual salient sentences, SgSum selects a salient sub-graph from the relation graph as the summary - the entire summary is more coherent and informative due to the direct output in the form of sub-graph.\nThe authors propose to study ASJ as a new benchmark for long neural abstractive summarization and story generation. They create a specialized dataset containing scientific papers and their Science Daily press releases for sequence to sequence applications.\nThe study introduces the task of AgreeSum which involves creating abstractive summaries that represent information common and faithful to all input articles. The paper also proposes the application of the pre-trained single-document summarization model PEGASUS onto AgreeSum.\nThe authors propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length and a discriminative training algorithm which directly maximizes the quality of the best summary, as opposed to the previous approaches which tend to use sentence-level decomposition.\nThe authors propose a novel multi-document summarization framework using a deep learning model comprising three parts: concepts extraction, summary generation, and reconstruction validation.\nThe authors propose improving the summary quality through summary-oriented visual features and devise two auxiliary tasks: the 'vision to summary task' and the 'masked image modeling task'. Together with the main summarization task, they optimize the MAS model using the training objectives of all these tasks.\nThe authors propose to use text summaries for topic labeling.

This novel design enables step-wise improvements on the beam search using a global scoring mechanism.\nThe authors propose an abstractive approach, where they generate a question-focused, abstractive summary of input paragraphs and then feed it to a Reading Comprehension system. The abstractive explainer is trained in a semi-supervised manner, starting from the supervised model and then further training it through trial and error, maximizing a conciseness-promoted reward function.\nThe paper details the creation of a neural abstractive multi-document summarization model that uses graph representations of documents such as similarity graphs and discourse graphs to more effectively produce summaries.\nThe authors propose ThresSum, a flexible and accurate non-autoregressive method for single document extractive summarization. It extracts a non-fixed number of summary sentences without the sorting step, but based on whether their predicted probabilities exceed a specific threshold.\nThe authors propose MuchSUM, a multi-channel graph convolutional network for extractive text summarization, designed to incorporate multiple salient summary-worthy features, such as textual features, centrality features, and position features.\nThis study proposes an automatic text summarizer that creates summaries by extracting sentence segments, where segments are broken down by cue markers and represented by a set of predefined features, then used by a supervised learning algorithm for extraction.\nThe authors propose a sliding selector network with dynamic memory for extractive summarization of long-form documents.

Instead of using diverse outliers or retraining the model, they rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score using these typical features.\nThe authors propose CLOM, a unified approach based on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and task masking, to solve both TIL and CIL problems. The key novelty is that each task is trained as an OOD detection model rather than a traditional supervised learning model, and a task mask is trained to prevent forgetting.\nThe authors approach the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem in an OOD environment with user feature shifts from a causal view, formulating the user feature shift as an intervention and OOD recommendation as post-intervention inference of the interaction probability.\nA new set of benchmarks and an approach, semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD), is proposed that focuses on the inherent semantics of the data rather than the low-level discrepancies between data sources.\nThe authors introduce ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain-independent, rule-based EE framework that is simple, powerful, robust, and fast. It allows for the mixing of syntactic patterns with surface, token-based patterns in order to recover from syntactic parsing errors.\nThis study proposes a framework which uses wild mixture data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Such data is abundant when a machine learning classifier is deployed in practical settings.\nThe authors provide a new formalization of OOD by modelling the data shifts, taking into account both the invariant and environmental (spurious) features. They explore how the spurious correlation in the training set impacts OOD detection.\nA new approach, Adaptive In-Out-aware Learning (AIOL), is proposed for OOD detection, which uses a temperature parameter to adaptive select potential ID and OOD samples from a mixed pool of unlabeled data. The approach also incorporates entropy over these samples. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are employed to account for OOD samples from unseen classes.\nThe authors propose a new OOD detection framework, MoodCat, that masks a random portion of the input image and utilizes a generative model to synthesize the masked image into a new image based on the classification result, and then computes the semantic discrepancy between the original and synthesized image for OOD detection.\nThe authors propose a multi-task curriculum learning framework that instead of training an OOD detector and SSL separately, integrates the detection of OOD samples in unlabeled data into the learning process.\nThe authors propose MetaOD, a data-driven approach to UOMS based on meta-learning. This model uses the performances of many detection models on historical outlier detection datasets to automatically choose an effective model for a new dataset without any labels, evaluations, or comparisons.\nThe authors propose a novel training mechanism that exploits the presence of OOD data for improved feature learning while avoiding its ill-effect on SSL. This is achieved by introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including OOD, performing a pretext task and a cross-modal matching strategy to detect OOD samples.\nThis paper presents two key ideas: one is the proposal of an alteration to the model training process to mitigate the OOD problem, and the other is the introduction of four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations.\nThe authors propose ODIN, a simple method for detecting out-of-distribution images that doesn't require modifications to a pre-trained neural network, based on the idea of using temperature scaling and adding small input perturbations to separate softmax score distributions of in-distribution and out-of-distribution images.\nThis study challenges the standard view, showing that full fine-tuning can result in poorer out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy than linear probing when pretrained features are high in quality and the distribution shift is large.\nThe authors propose an analytical framework for understanding OOD detection. This framework motivates a novel OOD detection method for neural networks called GEM, which shows both theoretical and empirical superiority.\nThe suggested method follows four design principles to address existing limitations: decoupling OOD detection from segmentation, observing the entire segmentation network rather than just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector from blind spots in the segmentation network, and localizing the generated data to simulate OOD objects.\nThis study sets out to define 1) what is considered OOD; 2) what it means for an OOD problem to be learnable. In addition, the authors introduce a new concept of expansion function, thereby giving a quantitative meaning to invariant features.\nThe authors propose a novel framework, Boundary Aware Learning (BAL), that can adaptively learn the distribution of OOD features. BAL uses a generator to produce OOD features progressively from trivial to hard, and a discriminator is trained to separate these synthetic OOD features from in-distribution (ID) features."

This framework translates the GW Riemannian framework previously developed by Sturm into simple tools for network data analysis.\nThe authors propose deep Wasserstein graph discriminant learning (WGDL) for encoding discriminative embeddings of graphs in Wasserstein-metric matching space. A graph dictionary, which is a reference set of graphs, is introduced to overcome the challenges of calculating class centers and support batch process learning.\nThe study introduces Wasserstein Coupled Graph Learning (WCGL), a method for cross-modal retrieval. It specifically constructs graphs based on cross-modal samples, uses graph encoders for feature extraction, and builds a Wasserstein coupled dictionary for further feature learning.\nThe authors argue and demonstrate that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously, implying that continuous DR maps must have imperfect precision. Moreover, they propose a new measure based on Wasserstein distance to evaluate `howu0027 wrong the retrieved data is.\nThe paper proposes the use of a Wasserstein distance (WS) to quantify both data shift and label shift in domain adaptation tasks, and introduces a new approach called the Label Matching Deep Domain Adaptation (LAMDA).\nThe authors take a key approach by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly integrating it within the Differential Privacy framework. This leads to the invention of a new distance measurement, the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance, which is a product of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance.\nThe authors present a framework named Aggregated Wasserstein for calculating a dissimilarity measure between two HMMs, leveraging the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the Wasserstein metric between distributions.\nThe authors propose a new relational discrepancy called spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (SSFG) that can identify important projection areas defined by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Two SSFG variants are introduced: mixture spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (MSSFG) which replaces the vMF distribution with a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions; and power spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (PSSFG), which replaces the vMF distribution with a power spherical distribution.\nThe study reveals that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously and therefore, a continuous DR map must have imperfect precision. A new measure is also proposed, based on Wasserstein distance, which addresses the shortcomings of precision in assessing the quality of retrieved data.\nThis study proposes a new semantic segmentation approach that incorporates severity-aware inter-class correlations into a Wasserstein training framework, which is configured using a ground distance matrix. The method can adaptively learn the ground metric in a high-fidelity simulator by following a reinforcement alternative optimization scheme.\nThe paper proposes a new optimal transport-based framework called Wasserstein Mixed Linear Regression (WMLR) for the MLR problem. The key idea of WMLR is to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target mixture regression models.\nThe authors propose a scalable Gromov-Wasserstein learning (S-GWL) method, a paradigm for large-scale graph analysis based on Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy which is a pseudometric on graphs. This new method can achieve both graph matching and partitioning using optimal transport.\nThe authors propose a more flexible method called tree-sliced Wasserstein distance that exploits tree metrics for closed-form computations and negative definteness. The sliced-Wasserstein distance is a special case of this method where the tree is a chain.\nThe authors propose a method to alleviate the computational cost of the Wasserstein distance by approximating it through finding an embedding where the Euclidean distance resembles the Wasserstein distance. This is achieved with a siamese architecture associated with a decoder network.\nA systematic study of distance metrics for 3D point clouds is conducted and a variant of the Wasserstein distance, the sliced Wasserstein distance, is proposed for learning representations of 3D point clouds.\nThe authors propose two Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulations to alleviate the limitations of the GW distance: a distance and an upper-bounding relaxation that allows comparison of metric spaces with arbitrary positive measures.\nThis paper proposes a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance, by converting the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution. This allows approximation of the indifferntiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD), which can be learned efficiently via gradient back-propagation.\nThe authors introduce the Graph Wasserstein Correlation Analysis (GWCA) - a method to handle cross heterogeneous graph comparison. This method uses spectral graph filtering to encode graph signals and embeds them as probability distributions in a Wasserstein space, referred to as graph Wasserstein metric learning.\nThe author proposes a novel analysis that optimizes the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for the UOT problem, which results in a near-linear time complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \u000barepsilon)$."

For the cross-lingual reverse dictionary task, it uses Multilingual BERT (mBERT), which can conduct the task with one subword embedding without needing alignment between languages.\nThe authors propose a simple yet effective lexical-level masking strategy, observing that temporal generalization is closely related to lexical semantic change, a key characteristic of natural languages.\nThe authors explore how mBERT performs on a broader set of languages, specifically focusing on the representation quality for low-resource languages. They also examine the possibility of improved performance by pairing low-resource languages with similar languages.\nThe study thoroughly investigates the performance of mBART in translating low-resource languages, through an empirical experiment considering five factors: amount of fine-tuning data, noise in fine-tuning data, amount of pre-training data in the model, impact of domain mismatch, and language typology.\nThe GLM-130B is introduced as a bilingual (English and Chinese) pre-trained language model with 130 billion parameters, aiming to be open-source and comparable to GPT-3."

The approach identifies the parameter space where long-lasting attack effects on parameters reside and disrupts that space during local learning.\nThis work is the first to study the risk of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures, highlighting a potential vulnerability in which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) upon which the model is trained has a cascading effect on multiple data values.\nThis study presents a novel equivalence between Byzantine gradient attacks, where workers report arbitrary gradients, and data poisoning, a scenario where input data is altered maliciously by workers.\nThe study examines a security threat to RL, where an attacker poisons the environment to force the agent to execute a specific policy chosen by the attacker, either by manipulating rewards or transition dynamics in a stealthy manner.\nIn this paper, the authors investigate a new type of data poisoning exploitation that increases the risk of privacy leakage of benign training samples. They focus on amplifying and exposing the membership of targeted classes through two proposed attacks: a generic dirty-label attack for supervised classification algorithms and an optimization-based clean-label attack in transfer learning scenarios.\nThe study proposes migrating backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explores the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation.\nThe authors suggest that poisoning attacks introduce localized high-loss regions, and thereby propose a two-component approach to alleviate these sharp loss regions.

Additionally, an algorithm is proposed to perform an online adjustment to the weight between the labeled real data and the generated data.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it.\nThe authors propose a new adversarial training approach for robustness over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nThe authors suggest a connection between the adversarial robustness of a model and the number of tasks it is trained on, proposing that models trained on multiple tasks at once can be more robust to adversarial attacks on individual tasks.\nThe authors propose adversarial domain augmentation as a novel solution for the OOD generalization problem. The technique involves using adversarial training to create 'fictitious' yet 'challenging' populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees.\nThe authors propose a novel robust adversarial training approach that dynamically generates adversarial examples based on currently model's parameters and uses them for further training in an iterative schedule to improve the robustness of MRC models.\nTo tackle the vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks, the authors propose Ensemble Adversarial Training, a methodology that enriches training data with perturbations transferred from other models.\nThe authors propose adversarial post-specialization, a new method of specializing the full distributional vocabulary, that exploits words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global specialization function, combining standard L2-distance loss with adversarial loss for more realistic output vectors.\nThe authors focus on promoting adversarial robustness in MAML and proposed a general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework which can use unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning.\nThis study analyses the perturbation on the input of the generator and its influence on the generated images, and proposes a smooth generator that investigates the tolerable input perturbation.\nThe authors point out that standard adversarial training methods that focus on fickle adversarial examples can make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples. Toward this, they propose Balanced Adversarial Training, incorporating contrastive learning to increase robustness against both types of adversarial examples.\nIn this work, larger bounds for adversarial robustness are explored, specifically against perturbations that may be perceptible but do not change human predictions. A novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), is proposed to align the network's predictions with an Oracle during adversarial training.\nThe study proposes a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. This method aims to improve model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and teaches models to make predictions based on significant words. It also addresses the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms.\nThe authors propose a model-agnostic method that generates adversarially sampled data based on the few support samples, and fine-tunes the embedding space of a base classifier in a manner that increases the classification margins of these adversarial samples, making the classifier more robust.\nThe authors propose a regularization method that involves generating adversarial examples by perturbing the word embedding matrix of the model and performing contrastive learning on clean and adversarial examples to teach the model to learn noise-invariant representations.\nThe authors develop a theoretical model to analyze how adversarial training aids transfer learning and propose that adversarial training in the source data generates provably better representations, increasing the accuracy of the target data predictor when fine-tuned on this representation.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThe authors find that adversarially robust models, although less accurate overall, outperform traditionally-trained models when used for transfer learning."

Furthermore, the authors present OSCAR, a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model to facilitate the understanding of programs.\nThe authors propose further extensions to LM-BFF, namely LM-BFF-MS, which includes prompts with multiple demonstrations based on automatic generation of multiple label words, and soft demonstration memory which consists of multiple sequences of globally shared word embeddings for a similar context.\nThe authors propose UniCRS, a unified CRS model, based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning. This approach combines the recommendation and conversation subtasks into the prompt learning paradigm, using knowledge-enhanced prompts based on a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM).\nThis study proposes a multi-stage prompting approach that leverages the inherent knowledge stored in the pretrained LM and its generation ability. The approach uses the pretrained language model to generate knowledge based on the dialogue context and then prompt it further to generate responses from the previously generated knowledge.\nThe authors introduced the idea of 0-shot prompts that outperform few-shot prompts in the GPT-3 model. They propose a broader theory of prompt programming that utilizes narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions, and deconstructs a problem into components before delivering a verdict.\nThe authors propose a novel method called Prompt-based Transfer Generative (PTG) for text generation in a transferable setting.

In the process, the authors present a concept of semantic patterns to communicate knowledge at a certain level of representation.\nThe paper proposes an innovative solution that uses a combination of lexical approaches and language games to reduce the complexity of the semantic problem by shifting from the ontology level to the simpler lexicon level and avoids the use of a centralized third party mediator.\nThe authors evaluate the feasibility of integrating an available discourse analyser called HILDA for a question generation system called CODA and introduce an approach for extracting a discourse corpus from the CODA parallel corpus.\nThe authors propose a framework that presents standards for annotating information status and provides guidelines for annotating information structure, i.e., theme/rheme and background/kontrast, in the Switchboard corpus.\nThe authors present two Propbank annotation tools, Cornerstone and Jubilee. Jubilee aims to expedite the annotation process by displaying multiple resources of syntactic and semantic information, while Cornerstone is an XML editor customized to allow frame authors to create and edit frameset files."
