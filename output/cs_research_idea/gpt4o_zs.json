The authors propose attacks that generate poisoned gradients for manipulated malicious users to upload based on two strategies: random approximation and hard user mining.\nThe authors discover that backdoor neurons are exposed by their pre-activation distributions, where populations from benign data and poisoned data show significantly different moments, a property that is attack invariant.\nThis paper focuses on data poisoning attacks against crowdsourcing systems that use the Dawid-Skene model, and proposes an intelligent attack mechanism which maximizes the attack utility while disguising the attacking behaviors.\nThe authors propose a new strategy for textual backdoor attacks that does not require an external trigger and ensures that poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The basis of this strategy is the creation of clean-labeled examples, the labels of which are correct but can cause test label changes when combined with the training set.\nThe paper introduces a $handcrafted$ attack that directly manipulates a model's weights. This direct modification gives the attacker more freedom compared to poisoning, and can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.\nThis paper proposes a method for detecting backdoors in neural networks, assuming no prior knowledge about whether a model is poisoned or access to a clean sample set. It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThe paper explores the possibility of model poisoning for backdoor attacks by leveraging the rarely utilized word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and introduces a new method specific to federated learning called Gradient Ensemble.\nThe authors propose a scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks. They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThis paper demonstrates the feasibility of a targeted attack on black-box NMT systems by poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data.\nThis paper proposes a practical data poisoning attack approach, LOKI, against blackbox recommendation systems under the general next-item recommendation setting. LOKI uses reinforcement learning to train an attack agent who generates user behavior samples for data poisoning, interacting with a recommender simulator to bypass the high cost of retraining models and user-interaction frequency restrictions.\nA stronger weight-poisoning attack method is proposed. This method introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper undetectable backdoors with a combinatorial trigger.\nThe authors propose two new types of data poisoning attacks where an adversary intentionally targets the system's fairness. The attacks are known as the anchoring attack and the influence attack on fairness, targeting fairness measures by skewing the decision boundary or maximizing the covariance between sensitive attributes and decision outcome respectively.\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attacks that attempt to evade traditional detection methods.\nThe authors introduce a model-based reinforcement learning framework that can orchestrate untargeted poisoning attacks against federated learning systems by approximating the distribution of the clients' aggregated data.\nThe authors propose adversarial poisoning training (APT) which simulates the poisoning process by introducing fake users known as ERM users dedicated to minimizing empirical risk, in order to build a robust system.\nThis paper introduces Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that increases the durability of backdoors in Federated Learning systems by attacking parameters that are less frequently altered during training.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable.

The authors also introduce structure regularization for generating more regular structures and a gradient separation strategy to integrate KD into the pruning process without interference.\nThis paper indicates a performance discrepancy in magnitude-based pruning between standard supervised learning and the zero-shot setting, and suggests two weight regularizers to maximize alignment between pruned and unpruned networks. This could reduce distortion in the alignment of pruned cross-lingual models and improve performance in both non zero-shot and zero-shot settings.\nThe authors explore layer freezing and data sieving as two techniques to effectively and efficiently reduce sparse training costs while preserving accuracy. Layer freezing is a technique used in dense model training and fine-tuning but has not been adopted in sparse training. Data sieving is a proposed method for dataset-efficient training, reducing costs by using only a partial dataset throughout the entire training process.\nThe authors propose a novel pruning method called Fairness-aware GRAdient Pruning mEthod (FairGRAPE) that minimizes the disproportionate impacts of pruning on different sub-groups by calculating the per-group importance of each model weight and selecting a subset of weights that maintain the relative between-group total importance in pruning.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors introduce a block pruning approach to create models that are both small and fast. The approach extends structured methods by considering blocks of any size and integrates this structure into the movement pruning paradigm for fine-tuning.\nThe authors propose a novel pruning method to further optimize the trade-off between efficiency and restoration accuracy by determining the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer.\nThe authors argue that the order in which pruning is carried out has significant impacts on model pruning. To this end, they propose a new approach to determining which layers should be pruned at each step, employing a long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the hierarchical characteristics of a network and generate a pruning decision for each layer."

CSG-Stump, a core part of the system, simplifies the complex tree structures of traditional CSG and is deep-learning friendly.\nThe researchers propose a novel point cloud representation that is mathematically proven to be rigorously rotation-invariant, which produces unique and consistent representations for identical point clouds in different orientations. The proposed representation is also conditional information-lossless, retaining all necessary information of point cloud except for orientation information.\nThis study introduces a Teacher-Student Multimodal Fusion (TSMF) model that fuses skeleton and RGB modalities at the model level for indoor action recognition. The model employs a teacher network to transfer skeleton structural knowledge to a student network processing RGB modality.\nThe authors propose 3DSmoothNet, a full workflow that combines a siamese deep learning architecture and fully convolutional layers using a voxelized smoothed density value (SDV) representation to match 3D point clouds. The method uses SDVs computed per interest point and aligns them to the local reference frame for rotation invariance.\nAuthors propose an efficient and holistic pipeline, 3R-Depth, that deeply integrates an efficient 3D shape estimator with existing recognition (e.g., ResNets) and segmentation (e.g., MaskR-CNN) techniques, thereby allowing it to simultaneously learn the semantics and structure of a scene from a single depth image.\nThe authors introduce ExtrudeNet, an unsupervised end-to-end network that can discover sketch and extrude from point clouds. The key features of ExtrudeNet are a new representation for sketch and extrude and a novel numerical method for computing the signed distance field used in network learning.\nThe authors introduce PPF-FoldNet, an unsupervised learning approach for extracting 3D local descriptors on point cloud geometry, based on the folding-based auto-encoding of well-known point pair features, which offers rotation invariance, benefits from point-set sparsity, and does not require a sensitive local reference frame.\nThis paper introduces a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (e.g., point clouds). The authors propose a simple loss function that encourages the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient.\nThis paper presents a deep neural net, named multi-view perceptron (MVP), that can separate the identity and view features from a single 2D face image and can also generate a full spectrum of multi-view images from the same.\nThis work proposes a novel deep neural network, FlowNet3D, that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end manner. This network learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings representing point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets.\n\"DeepVoxels\" is proposed as a solution, a persisting 3D feature embedding that encodes the view-dependent appearance of a 3D scene without having to directly model its geometry.\nThe authors introduce a 3D rotation invariant framework for point cloud recognition based on spherical symmetry, utilizing regular icosahedral lattice and its fractals to approximate and discretize sphere, which facilitates easy implementation of convolution to process 3D points.\nThe authors propose a novel end-to-end deep scene flow model, called PointPWC-Net, that directly processes 3D point cloud scenes with large motions in a coarse-to-fine fashion. They also introduce new cost volume, upsampling, and warping layers to efficiently handle 3D point cloud data.\nThe authors introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture that uses random point sampling and a novel local feature aggregation module to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds.\nThe authors propose a novel resolution-free point clouds sampling network that optimizes non-learning-based initial sampled points into improved positions. This network directly samples the original point cloud at different resolutions.\nA unified framework is proposed to streamline neural architectures for 3D point clouds, with the main innovation being the factorization of neural networks into a series of view transforms and neural layers. This enables a fair comparison of existing work and exploration of new designs.\nThe key idea is the 3DNN (3D Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm, which matches an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint of the image. It also automatically generates detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image and transfers information across images to label and segment objects in a scene.\nA deep learning architecture is presented which introduces grouping techniques to define point neighborhoods in the initial world space and the learned feature space. Additionally, dedicated loss functions, namely the pairwise distance loss and the centroid loss, are incorporated to further structure the learned point feature space.\nThis paper proposes an algorithm for analysis of pointwise robustness of neural networks that operate on 3D data.\nThe researchers propose a novel system, PointLIE, an approach to adaptive point cloud sampling and recovery. The system unifies point cloud sampling and upsampling into a single framework through bi-directional learning, encoding neighboring offsets of sampled points into a latent space."

DDSA seeks to bridge the visual space and semantic space by learning two bidirectional mappings, in order to obtain discriminative information about visual and semantic features within an aligned space.\nThe paper introduces a novel Time-Aware Sequential Autoencoder (TASA) that generates time-preserving user embeddings, reducing the need for redundant effort and task-specific feature engineering. These embeddings can be used across various tasks, considering the temporal aspects of sequences of activities.\nThe authors propose a two-step framework to learn relevant patient subgroups in an unsupervised way with a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder, and predict an outcome for separate patient populations in a multi-task learning framework, with each population as a separate task.\nIn this paper, the authors propose a simple extension of MAEs for spatiotemporal representation learning from videos by randomly masking out spacetime patches and reconstructing them using an autoencoder.\nA multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model is proposed that combines tasks related to human and machine vision to improve object detection in dark environments. The model learns the intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding realistic illumination-degrading transformations, considering a physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP).\nThe authors propose a new feature learning algorithm called the Multi-Task Autoencoder (MTAE) designed to achieve good generalization performance for cross-domain object recognition. Instead of reconstructing images from artificially induced noise, MTAE learns to transform the original image into analogs in multiple related domains, thereby learning features that are robust to variations across domains.\nThe paper presents a new model, Auto Encoder-coupled Transformer Network (AETN), which is designed to automatically model users based on their mobile app usage, in order to reduce manual efforts and improve performance.\nThe authors propose RaPP, a methodology for novelty detection with reconstruction along the projection pathway, comparing input and its autoencoder reconstruction both in the input space and in the hidden spaces.\nThe authors introduced the concept of a Modular Autoencoder (MAE) which is capable of learning a set of diverse but complementary representations from unlabelled data.\nThe authors learn new, effective features using the Deep Autoencoder (DAE) paradigm for phrase-based translation model, initialized by the unsupervised pre-trained Deep Belief Net (DBN) for semi-supervised fine-tuning.\nThis paper proposes video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE), a data-efficient learning mechanism designed for SSVP. VideoMAE uses video tube masking method having a high ratio to make video reconstruction a more challenging self-supervision task thereby enabling effective video representations.\nThe authors introduce the Transformer Autoencoder, which collects encodings of the input data over time to procure a global representation of style from a given performance.\nThe authors introduce SatMAE, a novel pre-training framework for temporal or multi-spectral satellite imagery based on Masked Autoencoder (MAE). This framework leverages temporal information via temporal embeddings and applies patchwise masking across time. Furthermore, it benefits from encoding multi-spectral data as groups of bands with distinct spectral positional encodings.\nThe authors propose to ameliorate the cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) problem by introducing a novel noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE) to teach the model to capture broader variations of the feature distributions, thereby boosting the generalization capability of the model.\nThis study presents GraphMAE, a masked graph autoencoder that addresses these development issues for generative self-supervised graph learning. Unlike traditional methods, GraphMAE focuses on feature reconstruction with a masking strategy and scaled cosine error which enhance the robust training of the model.\nThis paper presents an unsupervised method, the Transformer-based Sequential Denoising Auto-Encoder (TSDAE), for learning sentence embeddings, which outperforms previous methods by up to 6.4 points.\nThe authors propose an open-set recognition algorithm that uses class conditioned auto-encoders (C2AE) with distinct training and testing procedures. The training is divided into two sub-tasks: closed-set classification and open-set identification (distinguishing known from unknown classes).\nThe authors propose 'bootstrapped masked autoencoders' (BootMAE), an improvement to existing MAEs with two core designs: a momentum encoder and a target-aware decoder which reduce the pressure on the encoder to memorize target-specific information.\nThe paper proposes training an auto-encoder that encodes input text into human readable sentences. The auto-encoder is composed of a generator and a reconstructor. The generator encodes the input text into a shorter word sequence, and the reconstructor recovers the generator input from the generator output."

They also hypothesise that sensitivity to unseen inputs in neural networks maybe associated to multiple factors, which are amplified by the curse of dimensionality.\nThe authors introduce Unknown-Oriented Learning (UOL), a novel framework for OSDA, consisting of three stages: true unknown excavation, false unknown suppression, and known alignment. The UOL aims to better represent the complicated distribution of the unknown category by excavating diverse semantic information.\nThe paper introduces a new approach for OOD generalization by performing analogy-making and indirection in the functional space. To implement this, they propose FINE (Functional Indirection Neural Estimator), a framework that composes functions to map data input to output on-the-fly.\nThe authors propose ReAct \u2014 a simple and effective technique for reducing model overconfidence on OOD data, motivated by novel analysis on internal activations of neural networks that show distinctive signature patterns for OOD distributions.\nThe authors propose a novel, self-supervised approach for novelty detection that does not rely on pre-defined OOD data. This method evaluates the Mahalanobis distance of the gradients between the in-distribution and OOD data, and is assisted by a self-supervised binary classifier to guide the label selection to generate the gradients and maximize the Mahalanobis distance.\nThe paper analyzes overconfidence and classifies it into two perspectives: over-confident OOD and in-domain (IND). It then proposes a novel reassigned contrastive learning (RCL) to discriminate IND intents for over-confident OOD and an adaptive class-dependent local threshold mechanism for overconfident IND.\nThe authors formalize the OOD generalization problem as constrained optimization, called Disentanglement-constrained Domain Generalization (DDG). DDG aims to learn representations of semantic concepts that are invariant to nuisance factors and generalizable across domains.\nThe authors draw a link between OOD performance and model calibration, posing that multi-domain calibration represents an invariant representation leading to improved OOD generalization. They suggest multi-domain calibration as a measurable and trainable surrogate for the OOD performance of a classifier.\nThe authors propose interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD), a new OCC model that employs a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. This model distinguishes training samples based on their distances to the Gaussian center and the standard deviation of these distances.\nThis paper proposes an adaptive soft pseudo labeling (ASoul) method that estimates soft labels for pseudo OOD samples when training OOD detectors. The method uses an embedding graph to capture semantic connections between pseudo OOD samples and IND intents.\nThe main idea of this research is to mitigate the simplicity bias and improve OOD generalization by training a group of similar models to fit data in multiple ways. They achieve this through the use of a penalty on the alignment of models' input gradients. By doing so, this induces the learning of more complex predictive patterns.\nThe authors propose a principled and practical method for OoD detection with deep hybrid models (DHMs), which model the joint density of features and labels with a single forward pass. It factorizes the joint density into three sources of uncertainty.\nThe authors propose a new theoretical probabilistic framework for OOD detection in deep classification networks which uses two regularization constraints designed to calibrate and estimate sample density to identify OOD.\nThe authors propose a two-step procedure for improving OoD detection. Firstly, they introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on OoD samples, utilizing COCO dataset samples as OoD proxy. Secondly, they introduce 'meta classification' to discard false positive OoD samples by applying linear models to hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities.\nThis paper investigates the potential reasons for the mixed performance results associated with using CAD for OOD generalization. It suggests that even though features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust, it might prevent the model from learning other robust features, and CAD could reinforce existing spurious correlations in the data.\nThe paper proposes a generalized OOD detection method that is independent of out-of-distribution datasets, relying on self-supervised feature learning of the training samples, where the embeddings lie on a compact low-dimensional space.\nThe research concludes that this unexpected behavior of DGMs should be attributed to model misestimation rather than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions of interest.\nThe authors introduce a framework named E^3Outlier, designed for UOD that leverages a discriminative deep neural network (DNN) for better representation learning, using surrogate supervision to create multiple pseudo classes from original unlabelled data. It employs a new approach known as inlier priority, which prioritizes minimizing inliers' loss, to enable end-to-end UOD by discriminative DNN.\nThe authors introduce a new OOD score, called a locally most powerful Bayesian test (LMPBT), that is designed to maximize the probability of correctly detecting OOD samples under specified conditions.\nThe authors formulate two problems associated with graph data -- debiased learning and OOD detection, and propose a unified probabilistic model to tackle them, which includes modeling the graph's generative process and an additional latent environment variable as an indicator."

The approach uses Naive-Bayes models for each predefined webpage class, and an Extended version of Hidden Markov Model (HMMs) as website class models.\nThe authors propose a method for uncovering hierarchical structures within web pages based on in-page and cross-page link structures. A density-based clustering algorithm is developed to group densely linked web pages into semantic clusters.\nThis paper introduces the concept of topic identification of a web page based solely on its URL, leveraging machine learning techniques, which proves beneficial under conditions like prioritizing speed, enabling content filtering before downloading, dealing with content hidden in images, annotating hyperlinks in a personalized web browser, and when a focused crawler wishes to know a page's topic before downloading it.\nThe study proposes a novel approach to detect web genres (specifically, blog, wiki and forum) by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the webpage's HTML markup, without the need for a linguistic analysis of the page's content.\nThe study proposes a novel distributed search engine framework in which every web server responds to queries over its own data, and results from multiple web servers are merged to generate a ranked hyperlink list on the submitting server. The paper also presents new algorithms to compute PageRank within this framework.\nThe paper introduces an intelligent system that learns a user-specific search profile which embodies a user's search pattern and preferences. These patterns are represented by a probabilistic network which captures the semantic information from the user\u2019s keywords in the queries. This profile is then used to auto-modify user queries to improve relevance to their interests.\nThe paper proposes the block co-citation algorithm, which segments hyperlinks in a web page into blocks based on HTML structure and text style, and then assesses the similarity between hyperlinks in the same block to find related pages.\nIn this study, we utilize a weighted combination of the contents of neighboring pages to generate a better virtual document for classification, and break the pages into fields.\nThe authors propose a new method to organize search results that overcomes the mentioned problem. The idea is to exploit the thematic locality of the Web, meaning that relevant Web pages are often located close to each other in the Web graph of hyperlinks. Search results are grouped based on the length of a path between each pair of retrieved pages, which is estimated using multi-agent beam search.\nThe researchers propose a new methodology for webpage genre classification from URLs, which includes a novel algorithm for character n-gram decomposition."

A cascade classifier is designed to efficiently detect adversarials.\nThe authors propose a unique and practical mechanism for detection of model piracy by uniquely characterizing the profile of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model's decision boundary through its Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs).\nThe authors propose to explain adversarial attacks by estimating the contributions of different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the Shapley value, and they introduce a method to quantify interactions among adversarial perturbation pixels and decompose the entire perturbation map into relatively independent components.\nThe underperformance of conventional attacks is due to sub-optimal attack procedures, as they do not leverage the full representation capabilities of ViTs. This paper introduces two novel strategies to improve the transferability of existing attacks: a Self-Ensemble method for finding multiple discriminative pathways and a Token Refinement approach to enhance discriminative capacity at each ViT block.\nThe authors introduce a three-stage pipeline consisting of resized-diverse-inputs (RDIM), diversity-ensemble (DEM), and region fitting to generate transferable adversarial examples. They also explore the internal relationship between existing attacks and propose RDIM and DEM to exploit this relationship.\nThe authors propose looking at the success of both adversarial attacks and deep steganography tasks from a Fourier perspective, attributing their effectiveness to DNN's sensitivity to high-frequency content.

It covers the recent progression of universal adversarial attacks, studying the challenges from both attacker and defender perspectives, the reasons behind UAP existence, and also includes universal attacks beyond deep classification.\nThe authors propose a descriptor-based adversarial de-biasing approach called 'Protected Attribute Suppression System (PASS)'. PASS can be trained using descriptors from any previously trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously reduce the encoding of sensitive attributes, which eliminates the need for end-to-end training.\nThe authors suggest enhancing deep neural networks with a small 'detector' subnetwork.

They also introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property.\nThe authors propose an unsupervised network embedding method called SCE, which only uses negative samples for training. The method is based on a new contrastive objective that is inspired by the sparsest cut problem and includes a Laplacian smoothing trick to solve the underlying optimization problem.\nThe authors devise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to enhance contrastive learning. They also introduce a visualization scheme for positive and negative score distribution to analyze, interpret, and understand the learning process.\nThe paper introduces a new family of adversarial examples for contrastive learning and uses these examples to define a new adversarial training algorithm for SSL, known as CLAE.\nThe authors propose a new model named Critical Semantic-Consistent Learning (CSCL) that reduces discrepancies in both domain-wise and category-wise distributions, by highlighting transferable domain-wise knowledge and neglecting untransferable ones.\nThe authors introduce an alternative approach to few-shot segmentations based on contrastive learning, contrasting with the popular GAN-based understandings.\nThe authors propose Relative Predictive Coding (RPC), a new contrastive representation learning objective. RPC introduces relative parameters to regularize the objective for boundedness and low variance, and unlike prior approaches, does not use logarithm and exponential score functions.\nThe study proposes a theoretical argument that the representation matrix learned by contrastive learning boosts robustness through two properties: one prominent singular value for each sub-class in the data and a large alignment between the prominent singular vectors and the clean labels of each sub-class.\nThe authors propose a unifying framework for learning contrastive representations of stochastic processes (CReSP) that does not require exact reconstruction.\nIn this study, a detailed analysis of the feature learning process of contrastive learning is presented, focusing on two types of features: semantically aligned sparse features to learn from, and dense features to avoid. A principle called feature decoupling is also introduced.\nThe study proposes a novel way to leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate target feature learning, with an online pseudo labeling scheme with refinement that significantly reduces noise in pseudo labels. They execute the contrastive learning task simultaneously with pseudo labeling, following a scheme similar to MoCo but with a source-initialized encoder.\nThis paper presents a general method that mitigates these two problems by considering where and what to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. It proposes learning different augmentation invariances at varying depths of the model and expanding the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to lessen the misleading effects of strong data augmentations.\nThe paper proposes a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Learning (SPCL) loss for the ERC task, which uses the Prototypical Network to address the imbalanced classification problem through contrastive learning, without requiring a large batch size.\nA class-contrastive framework is proposed for explaining deep neural networks. This framework seeks to identify features with class-discriminative power, answering the question 'why is the input classified into this class, but not others?'.\nA contrastive learning approach is proposed where the neural network identifies the divergence of patterns in MWPs. This is inspired by the observation that neural networks tend to group problems with similar prototype equations together and fail at problems distant from these prototypes."

This closes the gap where no poisoning method exists for policy-based RL agents.\nThis paper proposes a generic data poisoning attack framework, I2Attack, for domain adaptation. This framework manipulates only source examples within domain adaptation algorithms and does so in a way that is unnoticeable, indirect, and invisible, thus aiming to degrade prediction performance on the target domain by maximizing label-informed domain discrepancy.\nThe paper proposes an efficient model-targeted poisoning attack against convex machine learning models, which comes with provable convergence to any attainable target model specified by an adversary.\nThe authors present a unified framework for backdoor attacks in 3D; specifically, they design two attack methods: poison-label attacks and clean-label attacks, motivated by recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples, and the proposed feature disentanglement method.\nThe authors propose DEFEAT, a novel and stealthy backdoor attack method that poisons clean data using adaptive imperceptible perturbation and restricts latent representation during the training process to enhance stealthiness and resistance to defense algorithms.\nThe paper proposes a new protocol for assessing the behavior of template update systems against zero-effort attacks, which depend on the ratio of impostor samples included.\nThe study proposes an attribute inference attack against extracted BERT models to illustrate the potential privacy leakage that can happen even when victim models utilize advanced defensive strategies.\nThe authors propose a new threat model that involves minimally altering the shared model architecture in a malicious manner. This allows the server to directly extract a verbatim copy of user data from the gradient updates, bypassing the need to solve difficult inverse problems.\nThe authors propose a black-box backdoor detection (B3D) method, which can identify backdoor attacks with only query access to the model. Along with detection, they also introduce a method for reliable predictions using the identified backdoored models.\nThis paper presents algebraic and hybrid algebraic/learning-based attacks on large-scale natural language models in a grey-box setting, which targets models with a pre-trained (public) encoder and a single (private) classification layer.\nThe authors investigate the code security of machine learning systems, focusing on how nucleus sampling can unintentionally leak texts typed by users, as the series of nucleus sizes for many natural English word sequences can serve as unique fingerprints.\nThe study introduces the concept of contamination attacks that are stealthy and capable of compromising the model's integrity in multi-party machine learning context where the local data remains private.\nThe authors reveal a threat where an adversary can implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by altering the training process. They propose a few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes a feature loss and the standard tracking loss alternately.\nThe authors introduce a novel strategy to generate high-quality fake user profiles under a black-box setting by leveraging publicly accessible items' attribute information (knowledge graph).

This new statistic provides more weight to errors at high rankings.\nThe authors propose a novel deep metric learning method, FastAP, which is based on a learning to rank approach. FastAP optimizes the rank-based Average Precision measure using an approximation from distance quantification.\nThe authors study AP loss in more depth and discover that the selection of ranking pairs between positive and negative samples is critical. Based on this, they propose two improvements: a novel Adaptive Pairwise Error (APE) loss, which targets ranking pairs in both positive and negative samples, and a method for selecting more accurate ranking pairs using normalized ranking scores and localization scores with a clustering algorithm.\nThe authors develop a theoretically rigorous, generalized counterfactual learning-to-rank framework to enable unbiased training for a broad range of additive ranking metrics and models, such as deep networks.\nThe author proposes a new distance measure to address the limitations of existing ones and applies it to a group multi-criteria decision making problem using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method."

This model's simplicity of perceptron training lends versatility and can be applied to various problem types where a learned edit model might be useful.\nThe authors developed a new program called word_align that takes the output of char_align and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown et al.\u2019s Model 2, modified to deal with robustness issues.\nThis study proposes to use algorithms based on basic word-association statistics to achieve alignment accuracy similar to standard models, but which are significantly faster and simpler.\nThis paper introduces a new word alignment combination approach that combines word alignments over multiple monolingually motivated word segmentations, based on a link confidence score defined over multiple segmentations.\nThe authors propose an improved method for automated word alignment that leverages easily-elicited knowledge to produce syntax-based heuristics which transform the target language (e.g., English) into a form more closely resembling the source language, before using standard alignment methods on the transformed bitext.\nThe authors introduce a framework for word alignment based on log-linear models, in which all knowledge sources are treated as feature functions depending on the source language sentence, the target language sentence, and additional variables. This allows for the incorporation of syntactic information.\nThe authors propose a novel method that generates multiple sets of diversified alignments based on different criteria like linguistic knowledge, morphology, and heuristics; then combines them to improve word alignment quality.\nThe authors propose to build on a recent probabilistic model of alignment to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. The focus is on understanding alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies.\nThe authors propose a coverage-focused method for word alignment that better models consistency and is more closely correlated with machine translation.

The authors propose an Interpolative Distillation (InterD) framework, which interpolates the biased and unbiased models at the user-item pair level by distilling a student model.\nThe authors propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework called Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB) which rearranges sequential sampling to constrain half of each mini-batch to coincide with the previous and subsequent iterations thereby guiding training stability and consistency.\nThe authors propose a new method for KD where only a limited number of unlabeled training samples and a black-box teacher are at disposal. The core idea is to generate a diverse set of out-of-distribution synthetic images using MixUp and a conditional variational auto-encoder to expand the training dataset.\nThe authors propose a comprehensive, interventional distillation (CID) method that captures both sample and class representations while removing bias through causal intervention. The softened logits, typically used as training targets, are considered as context information to eliminate biased knowledge.\nTSPipe, a pipelined approach, is proposed to accelerate the training process of any teacher-student frameworks including Knowledge distillation (KD) and self-supervised learning (SSL). The main idea involves scheduling the computation of the teacher and student network separately, and fully utilizing the GPU during training by interleaving the computations of the two networks and relaxing their dependencies.\nThe authors suggest combining low precision numerics and knowledge distillation - a method they call 'Apprentice' - to improve the performance of low precision networks.\nThe authors developed a two-phase pipeline leveraging self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization ability of CNNs for image classification. The first phase involves learning a teacher model through self-supervised learning, and the second phase is distilling the representations into a student model and fine-tuning the model for the image classification task.\nThe authors propose the adaptive sample weighting to KD, called Prime-Aware Adaptive Distillation (PAD) that incorporates uncertainty learning. PAD is able to identify prime samples in distillation and adjust their effect adaptively.\nThe authors propose a novel framework named Safe Distillation Box (SDB) which protects the intellectual property of pre-trained models by allowing inference ability to all users but restricting knowledge distillation to only authorized users.\nThe authors present a new method called Peer Collaborative Learning for online knowledge distillation, which combines online ensembling and network collaboration into a singular framework. It creates a multi-branch network for training where each branch is considered a 'peer'. The strategy also uses random augmentation multiple times on the inputs to peers to improve knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that utilizes Mixup, a data augmentation technique. MixKD enables the student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model not only on original training examples but also on linear interpolations of example pairs.\nThe authors propose a new distillation strategy for unsupervised learning called BINGO (Bag of InstaNces aGgregatiOn). The method emphasizes the importance of relationships among similar samples and aims to transfer these relationships, learned by the teacher model, to the student model.\nThis paper proposes an innovative self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge between distorted versions of the same training data. This mechanism is designed to bypass the need for accompanying models, instead focusing on learning consistent global feature distributions and posterior distributions across these distorted versions.\nTheir approach introduces a self-supervised learning algorithm where a soft similarity is used for negative images rather than a binary distinction. Using iterative similarity distillation, a slowly evolving teacher model is distilled to the student model by transferring the similarity of a query image to random images.\nThis paper proposes an online knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge of both class probabilities and the feature map using the adversarial training framework.\nThe authors propose a new training procedure for multi-exit architectures based on the principle of knowledge distillation, which encourages early exits to match the probability outputs of later, more accurate exits.\nThe authors propose Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-distillation (S2SD), an extension to DML, that leverages knowledge distillation from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces during training while maintaining test-time cost.\nThe authors propose a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) that blends the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one.\nThe authors propose a method to distill knowledge from a deep pose regressor network by using teacher loss as a confidence score, and assigning variable importance to the teacher prediction. This knowledge transfer is achieved through Attentive Imitation Loss (AIL) and Attentive Hint Training (AHT)."

This model learns local statistics of facial features, with distribution learning occurring in a subspace reduced by PCA.\nTwo novel techniques are proposed for face recognition: Dual Objective Feature Selection to learn and select only discriminant features, and Scaled Euclidean Classification to exploit within-class information for smarter matching.\nThe authors propose the use of familial social relationships as context for not only recognizing people but also for identifying the social relationships between pairs of people. They introduce a novel model for representing the interaction between social relationship, facial appearance, and identity.\nThe authors introduce a novel training method, called Multibatch, designed for similarity learning. It enables the creation of an invariant 'face signature' using pairs of 'similar' and 'not similar' face images.\nThe study proposes BioMetricNet, a novel framework for deep unconstrained face verification which introduces a regularized metric for comparing facial features. Instead of imposing a precise metric, the decision space is shaped by learning a latent representation that maps matching and non-matching pairs onto clearly separated well-behaved target distributions.\nThe authors propose a novel algorithm for black-box face recovery, based on the iterative sampling of random Gaussian blobs, given only an output feature vector of deep face recognition systems.\nThis paper proposes a privacy-preserving face recognition method using differential privacy in the frequency domain. This method first converts the image to the frequency domain, removes the direct component (DC), then learns a privacy budget allocation based on the loss of the back-end face recognition network within the differential privacy framework, and finally adds noise to the frequency domain features.\nThe study introduces a method that identifies coreferences between human names in newspaper articles and human faces in the accompanying photographs. The method is based on machine learning and a hypothesis-driven combining approach.\nThis paper suggests a holistic liveness detection paradigm that collaborates with standard techniques in 2D face biometrics, aimed at thwarting spoofing attempts.\nThe authors propose the new task of quantifying perceived face similarity between a pair of faces, which is distinct from face recognition. They also introduce the Lookalike network that is directed towards similar face classification.\nThe authors propose a face verification framework that uses sparse representations of image pairs and a dictionary for the generation of similarity scores, and exploit multiple feature transforms to obtain these scores.\nIn this study, authors propose a local appearance-based face representation approach using discrete cosine transform, and train multiple one-versus-all support vector machine classifiers corresponding to the individual classes of the specific task.\nThe study proposes to apply a family of biologically-inspired models, derived from a high-throughput feature search paradigm, to a large-scale, unconstrained real-world face recognition problem based on images from the Facebook social networking site.\nThe authors find that binary face templates are not secure and can be exploited by a masquerade attack, in which a face image, though not visually similar to the original, is constructed from binary templates to gain system access.\nThe authors present a plug-and-play framework for creating secure face templates with negligible degradation in the performance, in addition to proposing a significant bit-based representation that ensures security along with other biometric aspects such as cancelability and reproducibility."

This perspective re-expresses the underlying updates in terms of a limited choice of gradient form and scaling function, offering a parameterized space of approximate gradient updates for policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel approach called constraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO) that operates differently from many popular SRL algorithms. CRPO alternates between improving objectives and satisfying constraints during policy updates.\nThis paper introduces the Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an 'optimistic version' of the policy gradient direction, to address the issue of incorporating exploration in policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel policy optimization method called Constrained Update Projection (CUP), which provides rigorous safety guarantees. CUP is developed using newly proposed surrogate functions and performance bounds.\nThe authors introduce a non-parametric policy gradient approach, NPPG, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods. The key strategy is the use of Friedmann's gradient boosting, where policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models built in a stage-wise optimization.\nThis paper proposes a meta-algorithm for the statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data.\nThe authors propose that the state value baseline allows on-policy stochastic natural policy gradient (NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an O(1/t) rate and argue against the commonly believed idea that the primary function of baselines is to reduce variance of the natural policy gradient estimates.\nThe authors present Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization (TEPO), a new formalism for policy optimization, that generalizes previous works by incorporating Taylor expansions.\nThe paper introduces a method for stabilizing policy optimization when off-policy data is being reused. This involves the inclusion of a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that is generating the data and the current policy, which assures small and safe updates with off-policy data.\nConstrained Policy Optimization (CPO), a new general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning, is proposed.

EPPO notably integrates each policy with the policy ensemble and optimizes both together, and employs a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space to improve generalization to unseen states and encourage exploration.\nThe authors introduce Constrained Offline Policy Optimization (COPO), an offline policy optimization algorithm built upon a novel offline cost-projection method.

They identify that good global performance does not translate to improved personalization and propose decomposing the network into a 'body' (extractor) and a 'head' (classifier) to address this issue.\nThe paper proposes PartialFed, a novel approach where instead of loading the entire model as in most previous works, only a subset of the global model\u2019s parameters are loaded.\nThis paper presents FedX, an unsupervised federated learning framework that learns unbiased representation from decentralized and heterogeneous local data. It operates using a two-sided knowledge distillation approach with contrastive learning as a core component.\nThe authors propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (FairVFL) that learns unified and fair representations of data samples based on decentralized features in a privacy-preserving manner. The method involves local data representation learning and uses adversarial learning to remove bias inherited from the data.\nThe authors propose a novel federated learning framework that decouples a model's dual duties with two prediction tasks: one is trained as a generic predictor that is robust to non-identical class distributions across clients while the other is a lightweight adaptive module that is trained as a personalized predictor to minimize each client's empirical risk.\nThe authors propose a new framework, Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS), for training with only positive labels in a federated learning setting. It uses a server-side geometric regularizer after each learning round to encourage classes to be spread in the embedding space.\nThe proposed method reconstructs participant information such as the rounds of training users participated in, from aggregated model updates, using summary information from device analytics commonly used to monitor and manage federated learning systems.\nThe authors propose a federated learning approach that improves model performance by adding learned client-specific conditioning for situations when data is non-identically and non-independently distributed across clients.\nThis tutorial looks to explain the concept of federated learning using real-world tasks, covering basic concepts, scenarios, demonstrations with popular federated learning frameworks, and how to do automatic hyperparameter tuning with federated learning.\nThe authors present a framework to segregate the performance gaps coming from unseen client data and unseen client distributions in federated learning.\nThe paper proposes ensemble federated learning as a solution, whereby multiple global models are learned using randomly selected subsets of clients and predictions are made based on a majority vote among the global models.\nThe authors identified the biased classifier as the leading factor behind the sub-par performance of the global model. Consequently, they suggest a novel and privacy-preserving Federated Learning method for handling heterogeneous and long-tail data via Classifier Re-Training with Federated Features (CReFF).\nThe authors propose a novel method of federated learning where each client federates with other relevant clients to obtain a stronger model per client-specific objectives. This is achieved using optimal weighted model combinations for each client, determined by calculating how much one client can benefit from another's model.\nThe authors propose Compressed Vertical Federated Learning (C-VFL), a method for communication-efficient training on vertically partitioned data where a server and multiple parties train a model on their respective features utilizing several local iterations and sharing compressed intermediate results periodically.\nThe authors propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions. This helps decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL.\nThe authors propose 'FedSoft', a soft clustered federated learning approach which allows each local dataset to follow a mixture of multiple source distributions. This model not only trains personalized models but also high-quality cluster models in this setting.\nThe authors put forward a personalized federated learning framework, Local Calibration (LC-Fed), which leverages inter-site inconsistencies at both feature and prediction levels to enhance the segmentation process. The framework uses contrastive site embedding with channel selection operation to calibrate features and a disagreement-aware map to adjust the prediction.\nProposing a federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client, allowing many local updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation.\nAn unsupervised federated learning technique, Orchestra, is proposed. Orchestra exploits the federation\u2019s hierarchy to orchestrate a distributed clustering task and enforce a globally consistent partitioning of clients\u2019 data into discriminable clusters."

This approach is able to differentiate significant dissimilarities to pinpoint what makes two sentences a non-paraphrase and help recall additional paraphrases that contain extraneous but insignificant information.\nThe authors introduce a method for obtaining surface paraphrases, using a large-scale monolingual corpus.\nThe authors propose an approach to enhance the Competitive Linking algorithm and improve the bilingual dictionary.

This method relies on lists of words from different frequency classes.\nThe paper proposes a novel method for extraction of parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable, non-parallel bilingual corpora.

They theorize that a ReLU network with a small number of intrinsic parameters can approximate any Lipschitz continuous function with an exponentially small error.\nThe authors propose a new approach called 'Analytic Marching', which uses the fact that a ReLU-based MLP creates linear regions in its input space. From these regions, the authors identify analytic cells and faces associated with the zero-level isosurface of the implicit function.\nThe authors propose the idea that there can be convergence to low robust training loss for neural networks of polynomial width under natural assumptions, using the ReLU activation function.\nThe authors propose to estimate the parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using a gradient descent algorithm combined with median- or trimmed mean-based filters to mitigate the effect of the arbitrary outliers.\nThe authors model the optimization of a ReLU network using a geometric and combinatoric object known as a zonotope, leading to an analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal loss to perturbations of the training data and new insights into zonotope vertex selection relevance to optimization.\nThe paper identifies natural settings where depth 2 ReLU networks trained with gradient flow are provably non-robust, even when robust networks that classify the training dataset correctly exist.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to global optimality, and they establish new lower bounds on the size needed to approximate a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. They also construct a family of functions that scale exponentially with dimension.\nThis paper shows that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is limited by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. This limit, surprisingly, is independent of the depth of the network.\nThe researchers propose a study to prove that one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU networks of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can achieve competitive classification accuracy, even when data is corrupted by adversarial label noise.\nThe authors propose that the traditional requirement for each neural network layer to be larger than the previous can be replaced with a constant expansivity assumption, opposed to an exponential one. They also introduce the concept of 'pseudo-Lipschitzness'.\nThe authors proposed a training method using stochastic gradient descent for two-layer ReLU neural networks that demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks under specific conditions of separability in the RKHS induced by the infinite-width network.\nThis paper proposes a parametric framework named k-ReLU, which jointly approximates the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer. This allows the method to encapsulate dependencies between the inputs of different ReLUs, thus overcoming the convex barrier of single neuron relaxation.\nThe authors propose a novel methodology that applies a localized change in the function space for repairing ReLU networks. This methodology constructs a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which corrects the behavior on the buggy input when combined with the original network.\nThe authors propose that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.\nThis work aims to characterize the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the $L^p$ functions, using networks with the ReLU activation functions, and also examines the same with an additional threshold activation function and networks with general activation functions.\nThe authors propose a new efficient method for the verification of ReLU-based neural networks that uses dependency relations between the ReLU nodes, to prune the search tree that needs to be considered by MILP-based formulations of the verification problem.\nThe authors counter the belief in exponentially increasing length distortion with network depth by proving the expected length distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU networks with standard random initialization.\nThis research expands upon previous work by examining the effects of small perturbations of input vectors leading to large changes in outputs in ReLU networks of constant depth and a large range of widths, emphasizing the importance of bottleneck layers and arguing that these networks tend to compute functions that are locally very similar to random linear functions.\nThe authors propose fast algorithms and robust software for the convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. They reformulate the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set of group-l1-regularized data-local models under polyhedral cone constraints."

SPAIR comprises of a localization network that identifies degraded pixels, and a restoration network that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and feature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels.\nThe paper proposes a solution to texture recovery in super-resolution using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) layers that generate affine transformation parameters for spatial-wise feature modulation conditioned on semantic segmentation probability maps.\nThe authors propose a new, efficient SISR network\u2014IMDeception\u2014that uses a Global Progressive Refinement Module (GPRM) for feature aggregation and Grouped Information Distilling Blocks (GIDB) to decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations per second (FLOPS).\nThe authors propose a Deep Generalized Unfolding Network (DGUNet) for image restoration, incorporating a gradient estimation strategy into the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm to cope with complex, real-world image degradation, and designing inter-stage information pathways across proximal mapping in different PGD iterations to rectify intrinsic information loss.\nA novel learning-based framework is proposed to reconstruct higher quality light fields from acquisitions via learned coded apertures, without relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction."

This is achieved by clustering the irregularly distributed weights into structured blocks via reordering the input/output dimension, and then structurally pruning them.\nTo improve the efficiency of network pruning, the authors propose entropy-based pruning, a new regularizer that can be integrated into existing network pruning algorithms. This approach, based on the insight that reducing the information entropy of the network outputs decreases the upper bound of the subsequent decoding search space, could address the slowdown caused by conventional pruning methods.\nThe paper intends to investigate the usefulness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms to alleviate the sparsity problem in CAVR, which is a relatively unexplored area.\nThe authors propose a framework for understanding the internal dynamics of continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures.\nThis paper challenges conventional beliefs by checking several recent unstructured pruning methods and finding that some of these methods hardly use the training data and modifying the preserved weights per layer randomly does not influence the final results.\nThe authors propose Movement Pruning, an adaptive, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more suited to fine-tuning pretrained models.\nThis paper bridges the gap between the model interpretability of sparse convolutional models and the empirical performance of deep neural networks. It does this by incorporating differentiable optimization layers defined from convolutional sparse coding as substitutes for standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural networks.\nThe authors proposed DiSparse, a simple, effective, and first-of-its-kind multitask pruning and sparse training scheme that considers each task independently for disentangling the importance measurement and takes unanimous decisions among all tasks when performing parameter pruning and selection.\nThe authors argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. They formulate pruning as an optimization problem, casting the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and maximizing the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions.\nThe authors examine structured pruning on multilingual pre-trained language models, considering different settings, algorithms, and efficiency aspects, and present Dynamic Sparsification, an approach that allows training the model once and adapting to different model sizes at inference.\nThe authors introduce a network pruning based meta-learning approach with the aim of reducing overfitting by explicitly controlling the network capacity.\nThe paper introduces ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to derive a highly sparse network from an existing dense network. The Heaviside function is chosen due to its practical application in design optimization which also deals with material distribution as a discrete value optimization problem.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors propose a new method that combines the benefits of both pre-training and post-training pruning. This method prunes as early as possible during training without affecting performance. The method uses initial dense training to guide the architecture, constantly evaluates dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking, and introduces an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) to trigger pruning when the architecture stabilizes.\nThe paper proposes a method called Prospect Pruning (ProsPr) that overcomes the limitation of existing methods by using meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. It integrates an estimate of the higher-order effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network.\nThe authors introduce a deep learning inference optimization pipeline which consists of model compression methods like Tensor Decomposition, Graph Adaptive Pruning, Intrinsic Sparse Structures in Long Short-Term Memory, Knowledge Distillation, and low-bit model quantization.\nThe authors propose two operations, pruning and growing, that exploit the discovered sparsity of PC structures. Pruning removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression, and growing increases model capacity by expanding the size of the latent space.\nIn this paper, the authors propose a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. This method creates an initial population, then uses genetic operators to generate new networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible."

This approach can produce both natural language strings and deep syntax dependency trees from input dialogue acts, thereby creating a direct comparison between the traditional two-step generation approach and a joint, one-step approach.\nThe authors propose a new way of utilizing the powerful transfer learning ability of a language model via a perplexity score for few-shot learning in fact-checking tasks.\nThe authors propose a novel method that involves generating targeted synthetic data which identifies poorly attended entities; utilizing these entities ensures a more balanced and robust allocation of attention to all entities within a passage.\nThe authors investigate how pre-trained language models can be utilized to generate entire conversations given only a summary of a conversation as the input and explore three approaches to generate these summary grounded conversations.\nThe authors explore the use of large language models, like InstructGPT, for zero- and few-shot information extraction from clinical text without training it specifically for the clinical domain."

A policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is used to train the model.\nThe authors propose leveraging discourse structure to formulate a monotone (non-decreasing) sub-modular scoring function to generate more comprehensible summaries.\nThe study introduces a full-scale multimodal dataset for summarization that gathers documents, summaries, images, captions, videos, audios, transcripts, and titles in English from CNN and Daily Mail. A baseline model is also developed, which employs a newly proposed Jump-Attention mechanism based on transcripts.\nThe authors put forward an improved approach to extractive summarization featuring integrated random walk on a graph constructed based on topical/lexical relations. They also model intra-speaker topics by partially sharing topics from the same speaker in the graph.\nThe paper introduces MDSWriter, a new open-source annotation tool specifically designed for multi-document summarization corpus creation. This tool uniquely structures the complex summarization task into multiple steps for better efficiency.\nThe authors propose a novel multi-document summarization framework, SgSum, which treats source documents as a relation graph of sentences, formulating the task as a sub-graph selection problem. Instead of selecting individual salient sentences, SgSum selects a salient sub-graph from the relation graph as the summary - the entire summary is more coherent and informative due to the direct output in the form of sub-graph.\nThe authors propose to study ASJ as a new benchmark for long neural abstractive summarization and story generation. They create a specialized dataset containing scientific papers and their Science Daily press releases for sequence to sequence applications.\nThe study introduces the task of AgreeSum which involves creating abstractive summaries that represent information common and faithful to all input articles. The paper also proposes the application of the pre-trained single-document summarization model PEGASUS onto AgreeSum.\nThe authors propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length and a discriminative training algorithm which directly maximizes the quality of the best summary, as opposed to the previous approaches which tend to use sentence-level decomposition.\nThe authors propose a novel multi-document summarization framework using a deep learning model comprising three parts: concepts extraction, summary generation, and reconstruction validation.\nThe authors propose improving the summary quality through summary-oriented visual features and devise two auxiliary tasks: the 'vision to summary task' and the 'masked image modeling task'. Together with the main summarization task, they optimize the MAS model using the training objectives of all these tasks.\nThe authors propose to use text summaries for topic labeling. They suggest an algorithm based on submodular optimization to obtain summaries with high relevance, coverage, and discrimination for all topics.\nThe authors propose a calibrated beam-based algorithm that incorporates the global attention distribution to enhance neural abstractive summarization. This novel design enables step-wise improvements on the beam search using a global scoring mechanism.\nThe authors propose an abstractive approach, where they generate a question-focused, abstractive summary of input paragraphs and then feed it to a Reading Comprehension system. The abstractive explainer is trained in a semi-supervised manner, starting from the supervised model and then further training it through trial and error, maximizing a conciseness-promoted reward function.\nThe paper details the creation of a neural abstractive multi-document summarization model that uses graph representations of documents such as similarity graphs and discourse graphs to more effectively produce summaries.\nThe authors propose ThresSum, a flexible and accurate non-autoregressive method for single document extractive summarization. It extracts a non-fixed number of summary sentences without the sorting step, but based on whether their predicted probabilities exceed a specific threshold.\nThe authors propose MuchSUM, a multi-channel graph convolutional network for extractive text summarization, designed to incorporate multiple salient summary-worthy features, such as textual features, centrality features, and position features.\nThis study proposes an automatic text summarizer that creates summaries by extracting sentence segments, where segments are broken down by cue markers and represented by a set of predefined features, then used by a supervised learning algorithm for extraction.\nThe authors propose a sliding selector network with dynamic memory for extractive summarization of long-form documents. This method uses a sliding window to extract summary sentences segment by segment and incorporates a memory mechanism to preserve and dynamically update historical information, thereby ensuring continuity of semantic flow across different windows."

Instead of using diverse outliers or retraining the model, they rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score using these typical features.\nThe authors propose CLOM, a unified approach based on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and task masking, to solve both TIL and CIL problems. The key novelty is that each task is trained as an OOD detection model rather than a traditional supervised learning model, and a task mask is trained to prevent forgetting.\nThe authors approach the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem in an OOD environment with user feature shifts from a causal view, formulating the user feature shift as an intervention and OOD recommendation as post-intervention inference of the interaction probability.\nA new set of benchmarks and an approach, semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD), is proposed that focuses on the inherent semantics of the data rather than the low-level discrepancies between data sources.\nThe authors introduce ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain-independent, rule-based EE framework that is simple, powerful, robust, and fast. It allows for the mixing of syntactic patterns with surface, token-based patterns in order to recover from syntactic parsing errors.\nThis study proposes a framework which uses wild mixture data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Such data is abundant when a machine learning classifier is deployed in practical settings.\nThe authors provide a new formalization of OOD by modelling the data shifts, taking into account both the invariant and environmental (spurious) features. They explore how the spurious correlation in the training set impacts OOD detection.\nA new approach, Adaptive In-Out-aware Learning (AIOL), is proposed for OOD detection, which uses a temperature parameter to adaptive select potential ID and OOD samples from a mixed pool of unlabeled data. The approach also incorporates entropy over these samples. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are employed to account for OOD samples from unseen classes.\nThe authors propose a new OOD detection framework, MoodCat, that masks a random portion of the input image and utilizes a generative model to synthesize the masked image into a new image based on the classification result, and then computes the semantic discrepancy between the original and synthesized image for OOD detection.\nThe authors propose a multi-task curriculum learning framework that instead of training an OOD detector and SSL separately, integrates the detection of OOD samples in unlabeled data into the learning process.\nThe authors propose MetaOD, a data-driven approach to UOMS based on meta-learning. This model uses the performances of many detection models on historical outlier detection datasets to automatically choose an effective model for a new dataset without any labels, evaluations, or comparisons.\nThe authors propose a novel training mechanism that exploits the presence of OOD data for improved feature learning while avoiding its ill-effect on SSL. This is achieved by introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including OOD, performing a pretext task and a cross-modal matching strategy to detect OOD samples.\nThis paper presents two key ideas: one is the proposal of an alteration to the model training process to mitigate the OOD problem, and the other is the introduction of four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations.\nThe authors propose ODIN, a simple method for detecting out-of-distribution images that doesn't require modifications to a pre-trained neural network, based on the idea of using temperature scaling and adding small input perturbations to separate softmax score distributions of in-distribution and out-of-distribution images.\nThis study challenges the standard view, showing that full fine-tuning can result in poorer out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy than linear probing when pretrained features are high in quality and the distribution shift is large.\nThe authors propose an analytical framework for understanding OOD detection. This framework motivates a novel OOD detection method for neural networks called GEM, which shows both theoretical and empirical superiority.\nThe suggested method follows four design principles to address existing limitations: decoupling OOD detection from segmentation, observing the entire segmentation network rather than just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector from blind spots in the segmentation network, and localizing the generated data to simulate OOD objects.\nThis study sets out to define 1) what is considered OOD; 2) what it means for an OOD problem to be learnable. In addition, the authors introduce a new concept of expansion function, thereby giving a quantitative meaning to invariant features.\nThe authors propose a novel framework, Boundary Aware Learning (BAL), that can adaptively learn the distribution of OOD features. BAL uses a generator to produce OOD features progressively from trivial to hard, and a discriminator is trained to separate these synthetic OOD features from in-distribution (ID) features."

This framework translates the GW Riemannian framework previously developed by Sturm into simple tools for network data analysis.\nThe authors propose deep Wasserstein graph discriminant learning (WGDL) for encoding discriminative embeddings of graphs in Wasserstein-metric matching space. A graph dictionary, which is a reference set of graphs, is introduced to overcome the challenges of calculating class centers and support batch process learning.\nThe study introduces Wasserstein Coupled Graph Learning (WCGL), a method for cross-modal retrieval. It specifically constructs graphs based on cross-modal samples, uses graph encoders for feature extraction, and builds a Wasserstein coupled dictionary for further feature learning.\nThe authors argue and demonstrate that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously, implying that continuous DR maps must have imperfect precision. Moreover, they propose a new measure based on Wasserstein distance to evaluate `howu0027 wrong the retrieved data is.\nThe paper proposes the use of a Wasserstein distance (WS) to quantify both data shift and label shift in domain adaptation tasks, and introduces a new approach called the Label Matching Deep Domain Adaptation (LAMDA).\nThe authors take a key approach by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly integrating it within the Differential Privacy framework. This leads to the invention of a new distance measurement, the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance, which is a product of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance.\nThe authors present a framework named Aggregated Wasserstein for calculating a dissimilarity measure between two HMMs, leveraging the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the Wasserstein metric between distributions.\nThe authors propose a new relational discrepancy called spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (SSFG) that can identify important projection areas defined by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Two SSFG variants are introduced: mixture spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (MSSFG) which replaces the vMF distribution with a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions; and power spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (PSSFG), which replaces the vMF distribution with a power spherical distribution.\nThe study reveals that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously and therefore, a continuous DR map must have imperfect precision. A new measure is also proposed, based on Wasserstein distance, which addresses the shortcomings of precision in assessing the quality of retrieved data.\nThis study proposes a new semantic segmentation approach that incorporates severity-aware inter-class correlations into a Wasserstein training framework, which is configured using a ground distance matrix. The method can adaptively learn the ground metric in a high-fidelity simulator by following a reinforcement alternative optimization scheme.\nThe paper proposes a new optimal transport-based framework called Wasserstein Mixed Linear Regression (WMLR) for the MLR problem. The key idea of WMLR is to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target mixture regression models.\nThe authors propose a scalable Gromov-Wasserstein learning (S-GWL) method, a paradigm for large-scale graph analysis based on Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy which is a pseudometric on graphs. This new method can achieve both graph matching and partitioning using optimal transport.\nThe authors propose a more flexible method called tree-sliced Wasserstein distance that exploits tree metrics for closed-form computations and negative definteness. The sliced-Wasserstein distance is a special case of this method where the tree is a chain.\nThe authors propose a method to alleviate the computational cost of the Wasserstein distance by approximating it through finding an embedding where the Euclidean distance resembles the Wasserstein distance. This is achieved with a siamese architecture associated with a decoder network.\nA systematic study of distance metrics for 3D point clouds is conducted and a variant of the Wasserstein distance, the sliced Wasserstein distance, is proposed for learning representations of 3D point clouds.\nThe authors propose two Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulations to alleviate the limitations of the GW distance: a distance and an upper-bounding relaxation that allows comparison of metric spaces with arbitrary positive measures.\nThis paper proposes a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance, by converting the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution. This allows approximation of the indifferntiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD), which can be learned efficiently via gradient back-propagation.\nThe authors introduce the Graph Wasserstein Correlation Analysis (GWCA) - a method to handle cross heterogeneous graph comparison. This method uses spectral graph filtering to encode graph signals and embeds them as probability distributions in a Wasserstein space, referred to as graph Wasserstein metric learning.\nThe author proposes a novel analysis that optimizes the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for the UOT problem, which results in a near-linear time complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \u000barepsilon)$."

This results in unfluent target sentences that are used as auxiliary tasks during the training in a multi-task framework. This new approach aims at providing new contexts where the target prefix is not informative enough to predict the next word.\nThe authors present the idea of using a large-scale synthetic dataset to simulate the keystroke inference attack scenario, and propose a strategy of pre-training deep learning models on this synthetic data, before refining them with real-life data through transfer learning techniques.\nThe authors compile a large multilingual dataset of disaster-related tweets, and propose a masking-based loss function for partially labeled samples. They also employ and demonstrate Manifold Mixup's effectiveness in the text domain, and base their main model on Multilingual BERT.\nThe paper proposes a pre-training based automated Chinese essay scoring method, which has three stages: weakly supervised pre-training, supervised cross-prompt fine-tuning, and supervised target-prompt fine-tuning.\nThe study proposes training neural language models from scratch, without pre-training and only consuming words and characters, to align with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images and overcome limitations of attribute-based recognition."

The framework includes two new RE model architectures, an accuracy-optimized model based on BioBERT and a speed-optimized model utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN).\nThe authors propose that named entity recognition should be treated as a multi-class classification of word pairs. A novel neural model is designed, which applies a supervised multi-head self-attention mechanism, where each head corresponds to one entity type, allowing to construct the word-level correlations for each type. Furthermore, entity boundary detection and entity classification are fused in a multi-task learning framework.\nTo address the issue of representation collapse, the authors propose estimating the routing scores between tokens and experts on a low-dimensional hypersphere.\nThis research introduces RockNER, a new method to create natural adversarial examples at both the entity and context levels to test the robustness of named entity recognition (NER) models.\nThis paper presents C3EL, an unsupervised framework which combines CCR and NEL for jointly tackling both problems, where results from the CCR stage are incorporated into NEL and vice versa.\nThe authors treat the medical concept normalization problem as a sequence learning problem, employing recurrent neural networks and contextualized word representation models to generate semantic representations of social media expressions.\nThe authors propose a fully unsupervised Named Entity (NE) recognition model that works using informative clues from pre-trained word embeddings. The model uses Gaussian Hidden Markov Model and Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for entity detection and type prediction, and a reinforcement learning-based instance selector for distinguishing positive sentences from noisy ones.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework that can handle both flat and nested NER tasks by formulating NER as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task rather than a sequence labeling problem.\nThis paper proposes Near-Negative Distinction (NND), a new and simple automatic evaluation method for NLG, that repurposes prior human annotations into NND tests to evaluate the performance of a model. In an NND test, an NLG model must place a higher likelihood on a high-quality output candidate than on a near-negative candidate with a known error.\nThe authors propose to leverage Entity Resolution (ER) features in NLU reranking and introduce a novel loss term based on ER signals to optimize model weights in the reranking framework. Additionally, for multi-domain dialog scenarios, a score distribution matching method is proposed to calibrate the scores generated by the NLU reranking models for different domains."

The proposed system encodes the phrase using a recurrent network language model and learns to attend to the relevant image region to reconstruct the input phrase.\nThis paper proposes novel within-modality losses which aim to maintain semantic coherency in both the text and image subspaces, even if they do not necessarily align with visual coherency. This approach considers not only the proximity of paired images and texts, but also the expected image-image and text-text relationships.\nThe authors propose LapsCore, a representation learning method for language-guided person search based on color reasoning. Unlike existing methods, their method can explicitly build a fine-grained cross-modal association bidirectionally.\nThe authors propose to reconsider the multi-modal alignment problem in VideoQA from both feature and sample perspectives. They introduce the use of trajectory features and a heterogeneous graph architecture for alignment, and propose two training augmentation strategies to enhance cross-modal correspondence of their model.\nThe paper introduces a delicate mechanism for bridging the semantic gap between language input and generated visual content, and proposes a novel piecewise value function to break through the latent ceiling of fidelity in the compositing process.\nThe authors present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the context of attribute-based person search, which pulls images close to their person categories for modality alignment, and pushes apart a pair of person categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance."

Unlike DPA which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, Finite Aggregation first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers.\nThis study investigates and categorizes reward-poisoning attacks based on the infinity-norm constraint, providing infeasible attack's lower threshold and feasible attack's upper threshold. The authors highlight the underexplored area of adaptive attacks which depend not only on the state and action but also on the RL agent's learning process.\nThe study addresses the worst-case scenario of data poisoning attacks by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of attacks, for defenses employing first an outlier removal step followed by empirical risk minimization.\nThis paper proposes innovative priors such as diversity and topological simplicity to identify and improve the quality of potential triggers in Trojaned models.\nThis paper proposes CLPA, a novel clean-label approach for poisoning availability attacks, suggesting that due to intrinsic imperfections of classifiers, naturally misclassified inputs could be considered as a unique type of poisoned data, referred to as 'natural poisoned data'.\nThe authors propose the Lethal Dose Conjecture which states that if 'n' clean training samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-'N' training set, only \u0398(N/n) poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy.

They note that effective poisons move away from their original class and get isolated in the gradient space, suggesting that dropping examples in low-density gradient regions can eliminate effective poisons.\nThis paper proposes a client-based defense, FL-WBC (White Blood Cell for Federated Learning), to mitigate the impact of model poisoning attacks. The approach identifies the parameter space where long-lasting attack effects on parameters reside and disrupts that space during local learning.\nThis work is the first to study the risk of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures, highlighting a potential vulnerability in which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) upon which the model is trained has a cascading effect on multiple data values.\nThis study presents a novel equivalence between Byzantine gradient attacks, where workers report arbitrary gradients, and data poisoning, a scenario where input data is altered maliciously by workers.\nThe study examines a security threat to RL, where an attacker poisons the environment to force the agent to execute a specific policy chosen by the attacker, either by manipulating rewards or transition dynamics in a stealthy manner.\nIn this paper, the authors investigate a new type of data poisoning exploitation that increases the risk of privacy leakage of benign training samples. They focus on amplifying and exposing the membership of targeted classes through two proposed attacks: a generic dirty-label attack for supervised classification algorithms and an optimization-based clean-label attack in transfer learning scenarios.\nThe study proposes migrating backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explores the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation.\nThe authors suggest that poisoning attacks introduce localized high-loss regions, and thereby propose a two-component approach to alleviate these sharp loss regions. This approach involves the use of an optimized friendly noise to maximally perturb examples without degrading performance, and a randomly varying noise component."

They further extend this approach to propose a new trust region algorithm called Penalized NFAC (PeNFAC).\nThe authors propose Decentralized Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization (DD-PPO), a method that is distributed, decentralized, and synchronous, simplifying the implementation and leading to potential speedups in training.\nThe paper proposes to solve an entropy-regularized variant of the Markov game. The regularization introduces structure into the optimization landscape, making the solutions more identifiable and the problem more efficiently solvable.\nIn view of the success of ensemble methods in supervised learning on accuracy and generalization, the authors propose a new method: Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which employs ensemble policies in an end-to-end fashion. EPPO notably integrates each policy with the policy ensemble and optimizes both together, and employs a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space to improve generalization to unseen states and encourage exploration.\nThis paper introduces the Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, an approach that strikes a balance between the exploration and exploitation trade-off using an ensemble of learned policies (the policy cover).\nA new perspective is proposed, viewing policy gradient methods as the repeated application of two operators: a policy improvement operator and a projection operator, which leads to better understanding of traditional policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE and PPO.\nThe authors propose a method called Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) that can model the advantage function directly from on-policy data, minimizing the variance of the return, without necessitating the (action-)value function.\nThis paper investigates off-policy learning when the training data comes from multiple historical policies, proposing that policies, such as neural networks, can be learned directly from multi-logger data with counterfactual estimators.\nThe authors propose a new problem setting for continuous control, the Linear Quadratic Regulator with Rich Observations (RichLQR). Under this setting, the environment is summarized by a low-dimensional latent state with linear dynamics and quadratic costs. They introduce RichID, a novel algorithm to learn a near-optimal policy for RichLQR."

Additionally, an algorithm is proposed to perform an online adjustment to the weight between the labeled real data and the generated data.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it.\nThe authors propose a new adversarial training approach for robustness over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nThe authors suggest a connection between the adversarial robustness of a model and the number of tasks it is trained on, proposing that models trained on multiple tasks at once can be more robust to adversarial attacks on individual tasks.\nThe authors propose adversarial domain augmentation as a novel solution for the OOD generalization problem. The technique involves using adversarial training to create 'fictitious' yet 'challenging' populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees.\nThe authors propose a novel robust adversarial training approach that dynamically generates adversarial examples based on currently model's parameters and uses them for further training in an iterative schedule to improve the robustness of MRC models.\nTo tackle the vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks, the authors propose Ensemble Adversarial Training, a methodology that enriches training data with perturbations transferred from other models.\nThe authors propose adversarial post-specialization, a new method of specializing the full distributional vocabulary, that exploits words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global specialization function, combining standard L2-distance loss with adversarial loss for more realistic output vectors.\nThe authors focus on promoting adversarial robustness in MAML and proposed a general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework which can use unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning.\nThis study analyses the perturbation on the input of the generator and its influence on the generated images, and proposes a smooth generator that investigates the tolerable input perturbation.\nThe authors point out that standard adversarial training methods that focus on fickle adversarial examples can make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples. Toward this, they propose Balanced Adversarial Training, incorporating contrastive learning to increase robustness against both types of adversarial examples.\nIn this work, larger bounds for adversarial robustness are explored, specifically against perturbations that may be perceptible but do not change human predictions. A novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), is proposed to align the network's predictions with an Oracle during adversarial training.\nThe study proposes a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. This method aims to improve model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and teaches models to make predictions based on significant words. It also addresses the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms.\nThe authors propose a model-agnostic method that generates adversarially sampled data based on the few support samples, and fine-tunes the embedding space of a base classifier in a manner that increases the classification margins of these adversarial samples, making the classifier more robust.\nThe authors propose a regularization method that involves generating adversarial examples by perturbing the word embedding matrix of the model and performing contrastive learning on clean and adversarial examples to teach the model to learn noise-invariant representations.\nThe authors develop a theoretical model to analyze how adversarial training aids transfer learning and propose that adversarial training in the source data generates provably better representations, increasing the accuracy of the target data predictor when fine-tuned on this representation.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThe authors find that adversarially robust models, although less accurate overall, outperform traditionally-trained models when used for transfer learning."

In this approach, a smaller student model learns to rank items from both the training data and the guidance of a larger teacher model.\nThis paper proposes dynamic knowledge distillation, a new method that allows the student model to adjust the learning procedure based on its competency, thereby improving student performance and learning efficiency.\nThis paper introduces a novel alternating knowledge distillation approach for CPL. The approach exploits both content- and graph-based models to handle cases when some concepts are not discovered during training.\nThis work introduces a novel framework, 'prune, then distill', that first prunes the teacher model to make it more transferrable, then distills this knowledge to the student model.\nThe authors identify a problem they call 'imbalanced training', wherein final models pay more attention to recently exposed samples than earlier ones during static training. To address this, they propose a concept called Complementary Online Knowledge Distillation (COKD) that uses dynamically updated teacher models to provide complementary knowledge to the student model.\nThe authors introduce the idea of augmenting distillation with a third objective - the Interchange Intervention Training (IIT) which encourages the student model to imitate the causal computation process of the teacher model.\nThe authors extend the idea of knowledge distillation by allowing the training of a student model that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, taking advantage of not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher for better training and final performance.\nThe authors propose a 'Distill the Virtual Examples' (DiVE) method to tackle the long-tailed visual recognition problem, by treating the predictions of a teacher model as virtual examples.\nThe authors propose a novel scheme named Cross-Modal Knowledge Generalization. This trains the Student in a Target dataset where the Teacher is unavailable, by generalizing the distilled cross-modal knowledge learned from a Source dataset to the Target dataset by modeling knowledge as priors on parameters of the Student.\nThe paper introduces and investigates a concept called Nasty Teacher, a specially trained network that operates almost similar to a normal model but considerably degrades the performance of student models that attempt to imitate it. The authors propose a simple algorithm to build the Nasty Teacher, called self-undermining knowledge distillation.\nThe authors propose a novel knowledge distillation approach that aims to learn the teacher models that are more student-friendly and hence more appropriate for knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose a method called negative distillation. This involves introducing a negative teacher model that can produce query-wise generic responses, and then the student model is required to maximize the distance with multi-level negative knowledge.\nThe authors' preliminary study revealed that not all extracted knowledge is essential for training a good student model and that specific knowledge is beneficial at different training steps. Therefore, they propose an actor-critic method to select the appropriate knowledge for transfer during the distillation process.\nThe authors propose a novel training policy called Long Short-Term Sample Distillation that leverages both long-term and short-term teaching signals from previous training phases. The long-term signal provides guidance and teacher\u2013student differences while the short-term signal provides up-to-date cues for better updates.\nThe authors propose a simple knowledge distillation technique that directly reuses the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference. Feature alignment with a single \u21132 loss is used to train the student encoder.\nThe paper presents a model distillation method, referred to as 'structural model distillation', which allows memory reduction without needing to redesign the architecture; the method uses a student architecture that is a simple transformation of the teacher architecture and can use the same hyperparameters.\nThe authors present a novel method for knowledge distillation that optimizes the output feature of the penultimate layer of the student network. This method decouples representation learning and classification, using the teacher's pre-trained classifier to train the student's penultimate layer feature.\nThe authors propose a novel approach to knowledge distillation that uses a more intrinsic measure, leveraging global knowledge formed by the representations of instances with respect to a group of common basis vectors in the feature spaces of both the student and teacher models. This is achieved through a novel prototype generation module (PGM) that finds these common basis vectors, or prototypes, and a robust distilling module (RDM) that constructs the global knowledge and filters noisy local knowledge.\nThe authors propose a distillation technique for 'skeptical students', models that reduce a teacher's influence by learning from a shallow sub-section of the teacher's knowledge, enabling them to learn even from a nasty teacher.\nThe researchers propose a novel KD method that overcomes existing limitations by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and training a student model to mimic this flow."

As a result, they introduce Helper-based Adversarial Training (HAT), a new algorithm to mitigate this effect by including additional misclassified examples during training.\nThe paper addresses these issues by proposing mixup regularized adversarial training (MRAT), which can utilize multiple adversarial examples to increase a model's intrinsic robustness, without impairing its performance on normal data.\nThe authors propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT) that employs least adversarial (friendly adversarial) data that is confidently misclassified, instead of most adversarial data which maximize the loss.\nThe authors propose a model-agnostic method that generates adversarially sampled data based on the few support samples, and fine-tunes the embedding space of a base classifier in a manner that increases the classification margins of these adversarial samples, making the classifier more robust.\nThe authors point out that standard adversarial training methods that focus on fickle adversarial examples can make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples. Toward this, they propose Balanced Adversarial Training, incorporating contrastive learning to increase robustness against both types of adversarial examples.\nThe authors propose a new adversarial training approach for robustness over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nContrary to the conventional wisdom that more training data will help close the generalization gap between adversarially-trained models and standard models, the authors propose that increasing the amount of data may actually widen this gap.\nThe authors introduce the Targeted Adversarial Training (TAT) algorithm which improves model accuracy by introspecting current mistakes and prioritising adversarial training steps where the model makes the most errors.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThis paper proposes an approach called collaborative adversarial training to improve data utilization in DS-MIL RE by coordinating virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at different levels.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it."

Here, NER models from source languages are used as 'teachers' to train a 'student' model on unlabeled data in the target language.\nThe paper presents a new approach called contextual quantization of token embeddings. This decouples document-specific and document-independent ranking contributions during codebook-based compression, which in turn, allows effective online decompression and embedding composition for better search relevance.\nThe authors aim to examine the robustness of these models' ability to deploy relevant context information in the presence of distracting content by presenting models with cloze tasks requiring critical context information, and introducing distracting content."
