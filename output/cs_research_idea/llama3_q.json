They define a notion of equivalence for individuals in different language groups based on a similarity metric and propose measures to quantify group fairness based on similarity. They also develop a learning-to-rank approach to improve fairness.",

It introduces concept-based explanation metrics to assess the influence of a concept on labels which allows comparison of classifiers in terms of the degree of false global sufficiency they have learned."
