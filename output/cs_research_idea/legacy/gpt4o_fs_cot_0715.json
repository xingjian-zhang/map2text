The authors propose attacks that generate poisoned gradients for manipulated malicious users to upload based on two strategies: random approximation and hard user mining.\nThe authors discover that backdoor neurons are exposed by their pre-activation distributions, where populations from benign data and poisoned data show significantly different moments, a property that is attack invariant.\nThis paper focuses on data poisoning attacks against crowdsourcing systems that use the Dawid-Skene model, and proposes an intelligent attack mechanism which maximizes the attack utility while disguising the attacking behaviors.\nThe authors propose a new strategy for textual backdoor attacks that does not require an external trigger and ensures that poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The basis of this strategy is the creation of clean-labeled examples, the labels of which are correct but can cause test label changes when combined with the training set.\nThe paper introduces a $handcrafted$ attack that directly manipulates a model's weights. This direct modification gives the attacker more freedom compared to poisoning, and can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.\nThis paper proposes a method for detecting backdoors in neural networks, assuming no prior knowledge about whether a model is poisoned or access to a clean sample set. It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThe paper explores the possibility of model poisoning for backdoor attacks by leveraging the rarely utilized word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and introduces a new method specific to federated learning called Gradient Ensemble.\nThe authors propose a scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks.

LOKI uses reinforcement learning to train an attack agent who generates user behavior samples for data poisoning, interacting with a recommender simulator to bypass the high cost of retraining models and user-interaction frequency restrictions.\nA stronger weight-poisoning attack method is proposed. This method introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper undetectable backdoors with a combinatorial trigger.\nThe authors propose two new types of data poisoning attacks where an adversary intentionally targets the system's fairness.

CSG-Stump, a core part of the system, simplifies the complex tree structures of traditional CSG and is deep-learning friendly.\nThe researchers propose a novel point cloud representation that is mathematically proven to be rigorously rotation-invariant, which produces unique and consistent representations for identical point clouds in different orientations. The proposed representation is also conditional information-lossless, retaining all necessary information of point cloud except for orientation information.\nThis study introduces a Teacher-Student Multimodal Fusion (TSMF) model that fuses skeleton and RGB modalities at the model level for indoor action recognition. The model employs a teacher network to transfer skeleton structural knowledge to a student network processing RGB modality.\nThe authors propose 3DSmoothNet, a full workflow that combines a siamese deep learning architecture and fully convolutional layers using a voxelized smoothed density value (SDV) representation to match 3D point clouds. The method uses SDVs computed per interest point and aligns them to the local reference frame for rotation invariance.\nAuthors propose an efficient and holistic pipeline, 3R-Depth, that deeply integrates an efficient 3D shape estimator with existing recognition (e.g., ResNets) and segmentation (e.g., MaskR-CNN) techniques, thereby allowing it to simultaneously learn the semantics and structure of a scene from a single depth image.\nThe authors introduce ExtrudeNet, an unsupervised end-to-end network that can discover sketch and extrude from point clouds. The key features of ExtrudeNet are a new representation for sketch and extrude and a novel numerical method for computing the signed distance field used in network learning.\nThe authors introduce PPF-FoldNet, an unsupervised learning approach for extracting 3D local descriptors on point cloud geometry, based on the folding-based auto-encoding of well-known point pair features, which offers rotation invariance, benefits from point-set sparsity, and does not require a sensitive local reference frame.\nThis paper introduces a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (e.g., point clouds). The authors propose a simple loss function that encourages the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient.\nThis paper presents a deep neural net, named multi-view perceptron (MVP), that can separate the identity and view features from a single 2D face image and can also generate a full spectrum of multi-view images from the same.\nThis work proposes a novel deep neural network, FlowNet3D, that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end manner. This network learns deep hierarchical features of point clouds and flow embeddings representing point motions, supported by two newly proposed learning layers for point sets.\n\"DeepVoxels\" is proposed as a solution, a persisting 3D feature embedding that encodes the view-dependent appearance of a 3D scene without having to directly model its geometry.\nThe authors introduce a 3D rotation invariant framework for point cloud recognition based on spherical symmetry, utilizing regular icosahedral lattice and its fractals to approximate and discretize sphere, which facilitates easy implementation of convolution to process 3D points.\nThe authors propose a novel end-to-end deep scene flow model, called PointPWC-Net, that directly processes 3D point cloud scenes with large motions in a coarse-to-fine fashion. They also introduce new cost volume, upsampling, and warping layers to efficiently handle 3D point cloud data.\nThe authors introduce RandLA-Net, an efficient and lightweight neural architecture that uses random point sampling and a novel local feature aggregation module to directly infer per-point semantics for large-scale point clouds.\nThe authors propose a novel resolution-free point clouds sampling network that optimizes non-learning-based initial sampled points into improved positions. This network directly samples the original point cloud at different resolutions.\nA unified framework is proposed to streamline neural architectures for 3D point clouds, with the main innovation being the factorization of neural networks into a series of view transforms and neural layers. This enables a fair comparison of existing work and exploration of new designs.\nThe key idea is the 3DNN (3D Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm, which matches an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint of the image. It also automatically generates detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image and transfers information across images to label and segment objects in a scene.\nA deep learning architecture is presented which introduces grouping techniques to define point neighborhoods in the initial world space and the learned feature space. Additionally, dedicated loss functions, namely the pairwise distance loss and the centroid loss, are incorporated to further structure the learned point feature space.\nThis paper proposes an algorithm for analysis of pointwise robustness of neural networks that operate on 3D data.\nThe researchers propose a novel system, PointLIE, an approach to adaptive point cloud sampling and recovery. The system unifies point cloud sampling and upsampling into a single framework through bi-directional learning, encoding neighboring offsets of sampled points into a latent space."

The model learns the intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding realistic illumination-degrading transformations, considering a physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP).\nThe authors propose a new feature learning algorithm called the Multi-Task Autoencoder (MTAE) designed to achieve good generalization performance for cross-domain object recognition.

The UOL aims to better represent the complicated distribution of the unknown category by excavating diverse semantic information.\nThe paper introduces a new approach for OOD generalization by performing analogy-making and indirection in the functional space. To implement this, they propose FINE (Functional Indirection Neural Estimator), a framework that composes functions to map data input to output on-the-fly.\nThe authors propose ReAct \u2014 a simple and effective technique for reducing model overconfidence on OOD data, motivated by novel analysis on internal activations of neural networks that show distinctive signature patterns for OOD distributions.\nThe authors propose a novel, self-supervised approach for novelty detection that does not rely on pre-defined OOD data. This method evaluates the Mahalanobis distance of the gradients between the in-distribution and OOD data, and is assisted by a self-supervised binary classifier to guide the label selection to generate the gradients and maximize the Mahalanobis distance.\nThe paper analyzes overconfidence and classifies it into two perspectives: over-confident OOD and in-domain (IND). It then proposes a novel reassigned contrastive learning (RCL) to discriminate IND intents for over-confident OOD and an adaptive class-dependent local threshold mechanism for overconfident IND.\nThe authors formalize the OOD generalization problem as constrained optimization, called Disentanglement-constrained Domain Generalization (DDG). DDG aims to learn representations of semantic concepts that are invariant to nuisance factors and generalizable across domains.\nThe authors draw a link between OOD performance and model calibration, posing that multi-domain calibration represents an invariant representation leading to improved OOD generalization. They suggest multi-domain calibration as a measurable and trainable surrogate for the OOD performance of a classifier.\nThe authors propose interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD), a new OCC model that employs a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. This model distinguishes training samples based on their distances to the Gaussian center and the standard deviation of these distances.\nThis paper proposes an adaptive soft pseudo labeling (ASoul) method that estimates soft labels for pseudo OOD samples when training OOD detectors. The method uses an embedding graph to capture semantic connections between pseudo OOD samples and IND intents.\nThe main idea of this research is to mitigate the simplicity bias and improve OOD generalization by training a group of similar models to fit data in multiple ways. They achieve this through the use of a penalty on the alignment of models' input gradients. By doing so, this induces the learning of more complex predictive patterns.\nThe authors propose a principled and practical method for OoD detection with deep hybrid models (DHMs), which model the joint density of features and labels with a single forward pass. It factorizes the joint density into three sources of uncertainty.\nThe authors propose a new theoretical probabilistic framework for OOD detection in deep classification networks which uses two regularization constraints designed to calibrate and estimate sample density to identify OOD.\nThe authors propose a two-step procedure for improving OoD detection. Firstly, they introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on OoD samples, utilizing COCO dataset samples as OoD proxy. Secondly, they introduce 'meta classification' to discard false positive OoD samples by applying linear models to hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities.\nThis paper investigates the potential reasons for the mixed performance results associated with using CAD for OOD generalization. It suggests that even though features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust, it might prevent the model from learning other robust features, and CAD could reinforce existing spurious correlations in the data.\nThe paper proposes a generalized OOD detection method that is independent of out-of-distribution datasets, relying on self-supervised feature learning of the training samples, where the embeddings lie on a compact low-dimensional space.\nThe research concludes that this unexpected behavior of DGMs should be attributed to model misestimation rather than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions of interest.\nThe authors introduce a framework named E^3Outlier, designed for UOD that leverages a discriminative deep neural network (DNN) for better representation learning, using surrogate supervision to create multiple pseudo classes from original unlabelled data. It employs a new approach known as inlier priority, which prioritizes minimizing inliers' loss, to enable end-to-end UOD by discriminative DNN.\nThe authors introduce a new OOD score, called a locally most powerful Bayesian test (LMPBT), that is designed to maximize the probability of correctly detecting OOD samples under specified conditions.\nThe authors formulate two problems associated with graph data -- debiased learning and OOD detection, and propose a unified probabilistic model to tackle them, which includes modeling the graph's generative process and an additional latent environment variable as an indicator."

A cascade classifier is designed to efficiently detect adversarials.\nThe authors propose a unique and practical mechanism for detection of model piracy by uniquely characterizing the profile of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model's decision boundary through its Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs).\nThe authors propose to explain adversarial attacks by estimating the contributions of different image regions to the decrease of the attacking cost based on the Shapley value, and they introduce a method to quantify interactions among adversarial perturbation pixels and decompose the entire perturbation map into relatively independent components.\nThe underperformance of conventional attacks is due to sub-optimal attack procedures, as they do not leverage the full representation capabilities of ViTs. This paper introduces two novel strategies to improve the transferability of existing attacks: a Self-Ensemble method for finding multiple discriminative pathways and a Token Refinement approach to enhance discriminative capacity at each ViT block.\nThe authors introduce a three-stage pipeline consisting of resized-diverse-inputs (RDIM), diversity-ensemble (DEM), and region fitting to generate transferable adversarial examples. They also explore the internal relationship between existing attacks and propose RDIM and DEM to exploit this relationship.\nThe authors propose looking at the success of both adversarial attacks and deep steganography tasks from a Fourier perspective, attributing their effectiveness to DNN's sensitivity to high-frequency content. They also introduce two new UAP variants: high-pass UAP (HP-UAP) and Universal Secret Adversarial Perturbation (USAP).\nThe paper offers a comprehensive survey on universal adversarial attacks, focusing on UAP against deep classifiers. It covers the recent progression of universal adversarial attacks, studying the challenges from both attacker and defender perspectives, the reasons behind UAP existence, and also includes universal attacks beyond deep classification.\nThe authors propose a descriptor-based adversarial de-biasing approach called 'Protected Attribute Suppression System (PASS)'. PASS can be trained using descriptors from any previously trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously reduce the encoding of sensitive attributes, which eliminates the need for end-to-end training.\nThe authors suggest enhancing deep neural networks with a small 'detector' subnetwork. This subnetwork is trained for binary classification, identifying genuine data from data with adversarial perturbations."

A principle called feature decoupling is also introduced.\nThe study proposes a novel way to leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate target feature learning, with an online pseudo labeling scheme with refinement that significantly reduces noise in pseudo labels. They execute the contrastive learning task simultaneously with pseudo labeling, following a scheme similar to MoCo but with a source-initialized encoder.\nThis paper presents a general method that mitigates these two problems by considering where and what to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework.

It introduces a least squares formulation for dimensionality reduction, facilitating this integration.\nThe authors propose a novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace, resulting in a unified learning process which is particularly tailored for clustering and yields more structured results.\nThe paper introduces two approaches that enhance the discriminative ability of superpixel's covariance descriptors: the use of the Log-Euclidean distance as the metric on the covariance manifolds with the RBF kernel and extraction of the subspace structure of the set of covariance descriptors by extending a low rank representation algorithm on to the covariance manifolds.\nThe authors propose employing multidimensional scaling to reduce the problem of intrinsic structure detection to simpler 2D grid detection.

The basic word segmentation is based on n-gram language model, and a Hidden Markov tagger based on the POC-NLW template is used for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word identification.\nThe paper introduces a new approach to Chinese word segmentation, positing it as a classification task where character-boundaries (CB's) in a string are classified into either word-boundaries (WB's) or non-word-boundaries.

This allows the server to directly extract a verbatim copy of user data from the gradient updates, bypassing the need to solve difficult inverse problems.\nThe authors propose a black-box backdoor detection (B3D) method, which can identify backdoor attacks with only query access to the model. Along with detection, they also introduce a method for reliable predictions using the identified backdoored models.\nThis paper presents algebraic and hybrid algebraic/learning-based attacks on large-scale natural language models in a grey-box setting, which targets models with a pre-trained (public) encoder and a single (private) classification layer.\nThe authors investigate the code security of machine learning systems, focusing on how nucleus sampling can unintentionally leak texts typed by users, as the series of nucleus sizes for many natural English word sequences can serve as unique fingerprints.\nThe study introduces the concept of contamination attacks that are stealthy and capable of compromising the model's integrity in multi-party machine learning context where the local data remains private.\nThe authors reveal a threat where an adversary can implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by altering the training process. They propose a few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes a feature loss and the standard tracking loss alternately.\nThe authors introduce a novel strategy to generate high-quality fake user profiles under a black-box setting by leveraging publicly accessible items' attribute information (knowledge graph). They propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) which uses deep reinforcement learning techniques.\nThis work presents a version of a ModIvA attack by extracting 'canaries' or unique identifiable pieces of information inserted in NLU training data, aimed to test the model's data security."

The authors propose an Interpolative Distillation (InterD) framework, which interpolates the biased and unbiased models at the user-item pair level by distilling a student model.\nThe authors propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework called Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB) which rearranges sequential sampling to constrain half of each mini-batch to coincide with the previous and subsequent iterations thereby guiding training stability and consistency.\nThe authors propose a new method for KD where only a limited number of unlabeled training samples and a black-box teacher are at disposal. The core idea is to generate a diverse set of out-of-distribution synthetic images using MixUp and a conditional variational auto-encoder to expand the training dataset.\nThe authors propose a comprehensive, interventional distillation (CID) method that captures both sample and class representations while removing bias through causal intervention. The softened logits, typically used as training targets, are considered as context information to eliminate biased knowledge.\nTSPipe, a pipelined approach, is proposed to accelerate the training process of any teacher-student frameworks including Knowledge distillation (KD) and self-supervised learning (SSL). The main idea involves scheduling the computation of the teacher and student network separately, and fully utilizing the GPU during training by interleaving the computations of the two networks and relaxing their dependencies.\nThe authors suggest combining low precision numerics and knowledge distillation - a method they call 'Apprentice' - to improve the performance of low precision networks.\nThe authors developed a two-phase pipeline leveraging self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization ability of CNNs for image classification. The first phase involves learning a teacher model through self-supervised learning, and the second phase is distilling the representations into a student model and fine-tuning the model for the image classification task.\nThe authors propose the adaptive sample weighting to KD, called Prime-Aware Adaptive Distillation (PAD) that incorporates uncertainty learning. PAD is able to identify prime samples in distillation and adjust their effect adaptively.\nThe authors propose a novel framework named Safe Distillation Box (SDB) which protects the intellectual property of pre-trained models by allowing inference ability to all users but restricting knowledge distillation to only authorized users.\nThe authors present a new method called Peer Collaborative Learning for online knowledge distillation, which combines online ensembling and network collaboration into a singular framework. It creates a multi-branch network for training where each branch is considered a 'peer'. The strategy also uses random augmentation multiple times on the inputs to peers to improve knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that utilizes Mixup, a data augmentation technique. MixKD enables the student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model not only on original training examples but also on linear interpolations of example pairs.\nThe authors propose a new distillation strategy for unsupervised learning called BINGO (Bag of InstaNces aGgregatiOn). The method emphasizes the importance of relationships among similar samples and aims to transfer these relationships, learned by the teacher model, to the student model.\nThis paper proposes an innovative self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge between distorted versions of the same training data. This mechanism is designed to bypass the need for accompanying models, instead focusing on learning consistent global feature distributions and posterior distributions across these distorted versions.\nTheir approach introduces a self-supervised learning algorithm where a soft similarity is used for negative images rather than a binary distinction. Using iterative similarity distillation, a slowly evolving teacher model is distilled to the student model by transferring the similarity of a query image to random images.\nThis paper proposes an online knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge of both class probabilities and the feature map using the adversarial training framework.\nThe authors propose a new training procedure for multi-exit architectures based on the principle of knowledge distillation, which encourages early exits to match the probability outputs of later, more accurate exits.\nThe authors propose Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-distillation (S2SD), an extension to DML, that leverages knowledge distillation from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces during training while maintaining test-time cost.\nThe authors propose a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) that blends the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one.\nThe authors propose a method to distill knowledge from a deep pose regressor network by using teacher loss as a confidence score, and assigning variable importance to the teacher prediction. This knowledge transfer is achieved through Attentive Imitation Loss (AIL) and Attentive Hint Training (AHT)."

CRPO alternates between improving objectives and satisfying constraints during policy updates.\nThis paper introduces the Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an 'optimistic version' of the policy gradient direction, to address the issue of incorporating exploration in policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel policy optimization method called Constrained Update Projection (CUP), which provides rigorous safety guarantees. CUP is developed using newly proposed surrogate functions and performance bounds.\nThe authors introduce a non-parametric policy gradient approach, NPPG, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods. The key strategy is the use of Friedmann's gradient boosting, where policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models built in a stage-wise optimization.\nThis paper proposes a meta-algorithm for the statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data.\nThe authors propose that the state value baseline allows on-policy stochastic natural policy gradient (NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an O(1/t) rate and argue against the commonly believed idea that the primary function of baselines is to reduce variance of the natural policy gradient estimates.\nThe authors present Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization (TEPO), a new formalism for policy optimization, that generalizes previous works by incorporating Taylor expansions.\nThe paper introduces a method for stabilizing policy optimization when off-policy data is being reused. This involves the inclusion of a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that is generating the data and the current policy, which assures small and safe updates with off-policy data.\nConstrained Policy Optimization (CPO), a new general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning, is proposed. The algorithm has guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration and allows for training neural network policies for high-dimensional control while ensuring safety throughout training.\nThe paper proposes a mechanism to interpolate between a direct value estimate and a projected value estimate, computed from the reward and previous estimates. This approach reduces the need to learn about discontinuities, and thus potentially improves value function approximation.\nThe authors propose a fully decentralized and sample-efficient stochastic policy extragradient algorithm for solving tabular zero-sum Markov games, which uses multiple stochastic estimators to estimate the value functions involved in the stochastic updates and employs entropy regularization to boost convergence.\nThis paper proposes the concept of Characteristic Value Function (CVF), the frequency domain representation of the probability distribution of returns in reinforcement learning. Instead of representing a probability distribution function of returns, they propose to represent their characteristic function, which is the Fourier transform of their distribution.\nThe authors propose a method called Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) that can model the advantage function directly from on-policy data, minimizing the variance of the return, without necessitating the (action-)value function.\nIn view of the success of ensemble methods in supervised learning on accuracy and generalization, the authors propose a new method: Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which employs ensemble policies in an end-to-end fashion. EPPO notably integrates each policy with the policy ensemble and optimizes both together, and employs a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space to improve generalization to unseen states and encourage exploration.\nThe authors introduce Constrained Offline Policy Optimization (COPO), an offline policy optimization algorithm built upon a novel offline cost-projection method. This is designed to improve the state-of-the-art in offline constrained policy optimization by explicitly considering distributional shifts.\nThe authors propose a new method called Value Function Factorization with Variable Agent Sub-Teams (VAST) that approximates a factorization for sub-teams, which can be defined in arbitrary ways and vary over time to adapt to different situations, thereby offering a more focused and compact input representation of the original VFF operator.\nThis paper introduces a Bayesian framework that employs approximate posterior distributions to model the uncertainty of the value function in reinforcement learning, using Wasserstein barycenters to propagate uncertainty across state-action pairs.\nThe authors propose a novel policy gradient-style robust optimization approach, PG-BROIL, that balances expected performance and risk by optimizing a soft-robust objective. This is the first policy optimization algorithm that is robust to a distribution of reward hypotheses and can scale to continuous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)."

They identify that good global performance does not translate to improved personalization and propose decomposing the network into a 'body' (extractor) and a 'head' (classifier) to address this issue.\nThe paper proposes PartialFed, a novel approach where instead of loading the entire model as in most previous works, only a subset of the global model\u2019s parameters are loaded.\nThis paper presents FedX, an unsupervised federated learning framework that learns unbiased representation from decentralized and heterogeneous local data. It operates using a two-sided knowledge distillation approach with contrastive learning as a core component.\nThe authors propose a fair vertical federated learning framework (FairVFL) that learns unified and fair representations of data samples based on decentralized features in a privacy-preserving manner. The method involves local data representation learning and uses adversarial learning to remove bias inherited from the data.\nThe authors propose a novel federated learning framework that decouples a model's dual duties with two prediction tasks: one is trained as a generic predictor that is robust to non-identical class distributions across clients while the other is a lightweight adaptive module that is trained as a personalized predictor to minimize each client's empirical risk.\nThe authors propose a new framework, Federated Averaging with Spreadout (FedAwS), for training with only positive labels in a federated learning setting. It uses a server-side geometric regularizer after each learning round to encourage classes to be spread in the embedding space.\nThe proposed method reconstructs participant information such as the rounds of training users participated in, from aggregated model updates, using summary information from device analytics commonly used to monitor and manage federated learning systems.\nThe authors propose a federated learning approach that improves model performance by adding learned client-specific conditioning for situations when data is non-identically and non-independently distributed across clients.\nThis tutorial looks to explain the concept of federated learning using real-world tasks, covering basic concepts, scenarios, demonstrations with popular federated learning frameworks, and how to do automatic hyperparameter tuning with federated learning.\nThe authors present a framework to segregate the performance gaps coming from unseen client data and unseen client distributions in federated learning.\nThe paper proposes ensemble federated learning as a solution, whereby multiple global models are learned using randomly selected subsets of clients and predictions are made based on a majority vote among the global models.\nThe authors identified the biased classifier as the leading factor behind the sub-par performance of the global model. Consequently, they suggest a novel and privacy-preserving Federated Learning method for handling heterogeneous and long-tail data via Classifier Re-Training with Federated Features (CReFF).\nThe authors propose a novel method of federated learning where each client federates with other relevant clients to obtain a stronger model per client-specific objectives. This is achieved using optimal weighted model combinations for each client, determined by calculating how much one client can benefit from another's model.\nThe authors propose Compressed Vertical Federated Learning (C-VFL), a method for communication-efficient training on vertically partitioned data where a server and multiple parties train a model on their respective features utilizing several local iterations and sharing compressed intermediate results periodically.\nThe authors propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions. This helps decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL.\nThe authors propose 'FedSoft', a soft clustered federated learning approach which allows each local dataset to follow a mixture of multiple source distributions. This model not only trains personalized models but also high-quality cluster models in this setting.\nThe authors put forward a personalized federated learning framework, Local Calibration (LC-Fed), which leverages inter-site inconsistencies at both feature and prediction levels to enhance the segmentation process. The framework uses contrastive site embedding with channel selection operation to calibrate features and a disagreement-aware map to adjust the prediction.\nProposing a federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client, allowing many local updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation.\nAn unsupervised federated learning technique, Orchestra, is proposed. Orchestra exploits the federation\u2019s hierarchy to orchestrate a distributed clustering task and enforce a globally consistent partitioning of clients\u2019 data into discriminable clusters."

They theorize that a ReLU network with a small number of intrinsic parameters can approximate any Lipschitz continuous function with an exponentially small error.\nThe authors propose a new approach called 'Analytic Marching', which uses the fact that a ReLU-based MLP creates linear regions in its input space. From these regions, the authors identify analytic cells and faces associated with the zero-level isosurface of the implicit function.\nThe authors propose the idea that there can be convergence to low robust training loss for neural networks of polynomial width under natural assumptions, using the ReLU activation function.\nThe authors propose to estimate the parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using a gradient descent algorithm combined with median- or trimmed mean-based filters to mitigate the effect of the arbitrary outliers.\nThe authors model the optimization of a ReLU network using a geometric and combinatoric object known as a zonotope, leading to an analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal loss to perturbations of the training data and new insights into zonotope vertex selection relevance to optimization.\nThe paper identifies natural settings where depth 2 ReLU networks trained with gradient flow are provably non-robust, even when robust networks that classify the training dataset correctly exist.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to global optimality, and they establish new lower bounds on the size needed to approximate a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. They also construct a family of functions that scale exponentially with dimension.\nThis paper shows that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is limited by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. This limit, surprisingly, is independent of the depth of the network.\nThe researchers propose a study to prove that one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU networks of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can achieve competitive classification accuracy, even when data is corrupted by adversarial label noise.\nThe authors propose that the traditional requirement for each neural network layer to be larger than the previous can be replaced with a constant expansivity assumption, opposed to an exponential one. They also introduce the concept of 'pseudo-Lipschitzness'.\nThe authors proposed a training method using stochastic gradient descent for two-layer ReLU neural networks that demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks under specific conditions of separability in the RKHS induced by the infinite-width network.\nThis paper proposes a parametric framework named k-ReLU, which jointly approximates the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer. This allows the method to encapsulate dependencies between the inputs of different ReLUs, thus overcoming the convex barrier of single neuron relaxation.\nThe authors propose a novel methodology that applies a localized change in the function space for repairing ReLU networks. This methodology constructs a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which corrects the behavior on the buggy input when combined with the original network.\nThe authors propose that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.\nThis work aims to characterize the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the $L^p$ functions, using networks with the ReLU activation functions, and also examines the same with an additional threshold activation function and networks with general activation functions.\nThe authors propose a new efficient method for the verification of ReLU-based neural networks that uses dependency relations between the ReLU nodes, to prune the search tree that needs to be considered by MILP-based formulations of the verification problem.\nThe authors counter the belief in exponentially increasing length distortion with network depth by proving the expected length distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU networks with standard random initialization.\nThis research expands upon previous work by examining the effects of small perturbations of input vectors leading to large changes in outputs in ReLU networks of constant depth and a large range of widths, emphasizing the importance of bottleneck layers and arguing that these networks tend to compute functions that are locally very similar to random linear functions.\nThe authors propose fast algorithms and robust software for the convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. They reformulate the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set of group-l1-regularized data-local models under polyhedral cone constraints."

This method selects and modifies features by using a joined saliency map and attention mechanism.\nThe authors propose a simple adversarial augmentation method to modify training data to be hard positives/negatives without distorting key identity information. This is achieved by decomposing a sample into its VAE reconstruction and the residual, perturbing the reconstruction in the VAE's bottleneck space, and then adding it back to the original residual as an augmentation.\nThe authors discover that images contain intrinsic structure that enables the reversal of many adversarial attacks; modifying the attacked image to restore the natural structure can serve as a defense against these adversarial threats.\nThe authors propose the first robust superpixel-guided attentional adversarial attack method. The adversarial perturbations are only added to the salient regions and are ensured to be the same within each superpixel.\nThe authors propose a novel bi-level optimization algorithm that robustifies images to adversarial perturbations by finding points within the vicinity of natural images.\nThe authors propose cascade adversarial training which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks. They also propose a unified embedding space for classification and pixel-level similarity learning to disregard unknown pixel level perturbations.\nThe study proposes an image-based adversarial attack method specifically designed for medical images, which includes a loss deviation term to increase the divergence between the CNN prediction and its ground truth label, and a loss stabilization term to ensure similar CNN predictions for the example and its smoothed input.\nThe paper aims to create physically feasible adversarial attacks against visual tracking in real scenes with a universal patch to camouflage single object trackers. The authors propose a maximum textural discrepancy (MTD), a loss function that seeks to maximize the de-matching of the features between the search image and templates.\nThe paper introduces the Object-Based Diverse Input (ODI) method, which creates adversarial images on 3D objects and ensures the rendered image to be classified as the target class. The ODI method effectively increases input diversity by leveraging multiple source objects and randomizing viewing conditions.\nThis paper addresses this issue by using a targeted adversarial attack in the restoration process, in order to enhance the performance of object detection post-restoration. The authors introduce an ADAM-like adversarial attack to generate pseudo ground truth for restoration training.\nThis paper proposes a novel clone detection approach, Adversarial Clone Detection (ACD), which mimics the adversarial process between plagiarists and detectors. It is designed to build a robust clone detectector and also to model the behavior of plagiarists.\nThe authors propose a novel algorithm that can anonymize selected attributes in an image that a user does not wish to share, without compromising the visual quality of the images. The algorithm uses adversarial perturbation to embed imperceptible noise that leads to incorrect classification of the chosen attributes while preserving identity information and visual content.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to process images, leveraging on the model's robustness and adversarial attacks' object location agnosticity to match natural image statistics, effectively defending against adversarial manipulations.\nThe authors propose the use of adversarial examples for both images and questions as augmented data, which does not alter the visual properties in the image or the semantic meaning of the question, therefore, maintaining the correctness of the image-question-answer triplet."

This approach, based on the insight that reducing the information entropy of the network outputs decreases the upper bound of the subsequent decoding search space, could address the slowdown caused by conventional pruning methods.\nThe paper intends to investigate the usefulness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms to alleviate the sparsity problem in CAVR, which is a relatively unexplored area.\nThe authors propose a framework for understanding the internal dynamics of continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures.\nThis paper challenges conventional beliefs by checking several recent unstructured pruning methods and finding that some of these methods hardly use the training data and modifying the preserved weights per layer randomly does not influence the final results.\nThe authors propose Movement Pruning, an adaptive, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more suited to fine-tuning pretrained models.\nThis paper bridges the gap between the model interpretability of sparse convolutional models and the empirical performance of deep neural networks. It does this by incorporating differentiable optimization layers defined from convolutional sparse coding as substitutes for standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural networks.\nThe authors proposed DiSparse, a simple, effective, and first-of-its-kind multitask pruning and sparse training scheme that considers each task independently for disentangling the importance measurement and takes unanimous decisions among all tasks when performing parameter pruning and selection.\nThe authors argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. They formulate pruning as an optimization problem, casting the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and maximizing the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions.\nThe authors examine structured pruning on multilingual pre-trained language models, considering different settings, algorithms, and efficiency aspects, and present Dynamic Sparsification, an approach that allows training the model once and adapting to different model sizes at inference.\nThe authors introduce a network pruning based meta-learning approach with the aim of reducing overfitting by explicitly controlling the network capacity.\nThe paper introduces ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to derive a highly sparse network from an existing dense network. The Heaviside function is chosen due to its practical application in design optimization which also deals with material distribution as a discrete value optimization problem.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors propose a new method that combines the benefits of both pre-training and post-training pruning. This method prunes as early as possible during training without affecting performance. The method uses initial dense training to guide the architecture, constantly evaluates dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking, and introduces an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) to trigger pruning when the architecture stabilizes.\nThe paper proposes a method called Prospect Pruning (ProsPr) that overcomes the limitation of existing methods by using meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. It integrates an estimate of the higher-order effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network.\nThe authors introduce a deep learning inference optimization pipeline which consists of model compression methods like Tensor Decomposition, Graph Adaptive Pruning, Intrinsic Sparse Structures in Long Short-Term Memory, Knowledge Distillation, and low-bit model quantization.\nThe authors propose two operations, pruning and growing, that exploit the discovered sparsity of PC structures. Pruning removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression, and growing increases model capacity by expanding the size of the latent space.\nIn this paper, the authors propose a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. This method creates an initial population, then uses genetic operators to generate new networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible."

Instead of using diverse outliers or retraining the model, they rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score using these typical features.\nThe authors propose CLOM, a unified approach based on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and task masking, to solve both TIL and CIL problems. The key novelty is that each task is trained as an OOD detection model rather than a traditional supervised learning model, and a task mask is trained to prevent forgetting.\nThe authors approach the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem in an OOD environment with user feature shifts from a causal view, formulating the user feature shift as an intervention and OOD recommendation as post-intervention inference of the interaction probability.\nA new set of benchmarks and an approach, semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD), is proposed that focuses on the inherent semantics of the data rather than the low-level discrepancies between data sources.\nThe authors introduce ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain-independent, rule-based EE framework that is simple, powerful, robust, and fast. It allows for the mixing of syntactic patterns with surface, token-based patterns in order to recover from syntactic parsing errors.\nThis study proposes a framework which uses wild mixture data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Such data is abundant when a machine learning classifier is deployed in practical settings.\nThe authors provide a new formalization of OOD by modelling the data shifts, taking into account both the invariant and environmental (spurious) features. They explore how the spurious correlation in the training set impacts OOD detection.\nA new approach, Adaptive In-Out-aware Learning (AIOL), is proposed for OOD detection, which uses a temperature parameter to adaptive select potential ID and OOD samples from a mixed pool of unlabeled data. The approach also incorporates entropy over these samples. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are employed to account for OOD samples from unseen classes.\nThe authors propose a new OOD detection framework, MoodCat, that masks a random portion of the input image and utilizes a generative model to synthesize the masked image into a new image based on the classification result, and then computes the semantic discrepancy between the original and synthesized image for OOD detection.\nThe authors propose a multi-task curriculum learning framework that instead of training an OOD detector and SSL separately, integrates the detection of OOD samples in unlabeled data into the learning process.\nThe authors propose MetaOD, a data-driven approach to UOMS based on meta-learning. This model uses the performances of many detection models on historical outlier detection datasets to automatically choose an effective model for a new dataset without any labels, evaluations, or comparisons.\nThe authors propose a novel training mechanism that exploits the presence of OOD data for improved feature learning while avoiding its ill-effect on SSL. This is achieved by introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including OOD, performing a pretext task and a cross-modal matching strategy to detect OOD samples.\nThis paper presents two key ideas: one is the proposal of an alteration to the model training process to mitigate the OOD problem, and the other is the introduction of four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations.\nThe authors propose ODIN, a simple method for detecting out-of-distribution images that doesn't require modifications to a pre-trained neural network, based on the idea of using temperature scaling and adding small input perturbations to separate softmax score distributions of in-distribution and out-of-distribution images.\nThis study challenges the standard view, showing that full fine-tuning can result in poorer out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy than linear probing when pretrained features are high in quality and the distribution shift is large.\nThe authors propose an analytical framework for understanding OOD detection. This framework motivates a novel OOD detection method for neural networks called GEM, which shows both theoretical and empirical superiority.\nThe suggested method follows four design principles to address existing limitations: decoupling OOD detection from segmentation, observing the entire segmentation network rather than just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector from blind spots in the segmentation network, and localizing the generated data to simulate OOD objects.\nThis study sets out to define 1) what is considered OOD; 2) what it means for an OOD problem to be learnable. In addition, the authors introduce a new concept of expansion function, thereby giving a quantitative meaning to invariant features.\nThe authors propose a novel framework, Boundary Aware Learning (BAL), that can adaptively learn the distribution of OOD features. BAL uses a generator to produce OOD features progressively from trivial to hard, and a discriminator is trained to separate these synthetic OOD features from in-distribution (ID) features."

This framework translates the GW Riemannian framework previously developed by Sturm into simple tools for network data analysis.\nThe authors propose deep Wasserstein graph discriminant learning (WGDL) for encoding discriminative embeddings of graphs in Wasserstein-metric matching space. A graph dictionary, which is a reference set of graphs, is introduced to overcome the challenges of calculating class centers and support batch process learning.\nThe study introduces Wasserstein Coupled Graph Learning (WCGL), a method for cross-modal retrieval. It specifically constructs graphs based on cross-modal samples, uses graph encoders for feature extraction, and builds a Wasserstein coupled dictionary for further feature learning.\nThe authors argue and demonstrate that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously, implying that continuous DR maps must have imperfect precision. Moreover, they propose a new measure based on Wasserstein distance to evaluate `howu0027 wrong the retrieved data is.\nThe paper proposes the use of a Wasserstein distance (WS) to quantify both data shift and label shift in domain adaptation tasks, and introduces a new approach called the Label Matching Deep Domain Adaptation (LAMDA).\nThe authors take a key approach by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly integrating it within the Differential Privacy framework. This leads to the invention of a new distance measurement, the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance, which is a product of adding a Gaussian perturbation to the intrinsic randomized mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance.\nThe authors present a framework named Aggregated Wasserstein for calculating a dissimilarity measure between two HMMs, leveraging the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the Wasserstein metric between distributions.\nThe authors propose a new relational discrepancy called spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (SSFG) that can identify important projection areas defined by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Two SSFG variants are introduced: mixture spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (MSSFG) which replaces the vMF distribution with a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions; and power spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (PSSFG), which replaces the vMF distribution with a power spherical distribution.\nThe study reveals that no DR maps can achieve perfect precision and perfect recall simultaneously and therefore, a continuous DR map must have imperfect precision. A new measure is also proposed, based on Wasserstein distance, which addresses the shortcomings of precision in assessing the quality of retrieved data.\nThis study proposes a new semantic segmentation approach that incorporates severity-aware inter-class correlations into a Wasserstein training framework, which is configured using a ground distance matrix. The method can adaptively learn the ground metric in a high-fidelity simulator by following a reinforcement alternative optimization scheme.\nThe paper proposes a new optimal transport-based framework called Wasserstein Mixed Linear Regression (WMLR) for the MLR problem. The key idea of WMLR is to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target mixture regression models.\nThe authors propose a scalable Gromov-Wasserstein learning (S-GWL) method, a paradigm for large-scale graph analysis based on Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy which is a pseudometric on graphs. This new method can achieve both graph matching and partitioning using optimal transport.\nThe authors propose a more flexible method called tree-sliced Wasserstein distance that exploits tree metrics for closed-form computations and negative definteness. The sliced-Wasserstein distance is a special case of this method where the tree is a chain.\nThe authors propose a method to alleviate the computational cost of the Wasserstein distance by approximating it through finding an embedding where the Euclidean distance resembles the Wasserstein distance. This is achieved with a siamese architecture associated with a decoder network.\nA systematic study of distance metrics for 3D point clouds is conducted and a variant of the Wasserstein distance, the sliced Wasserstein distance, is proposed for learning representations of 3D point clouds.\nThe authors propose two Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulations to alleviate the limitations of the GW distance: a distance and an upper-bounding relaxation that allows comparison of metric spaces with arbitrary positive measures.\nThis paper proposes a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance, by converting the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution. This allows approximation of the indifferntiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance (GWD), which can be learned efficiently via gradient back-propagation.\nThe authors introduce the Graph Wasserstein Correlation Analysis (GWCA) - a method to handle cross heterogeneous graph comparison. This method uses spectral graph filtering to encode graph signals and embeds them as probability distributions in a Wasserstein space, referred to as graph Wasserstein metric learning.\nThe author proposes a novel analysis that optimizes the complexity of the Sinkhorn algorithm for the UOT problem, which results in a near-linear time complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2/ \u000barepsilon)$."

A novel algorithm for sentence removal is defined that rather than ranking sentences and selecting the most important ones, it proceeds to iteratively remove unimportant sentences until a target compression rate is achieved.\nThe work proposes NarraSum, a large-scale narrative summarization dataset. This dataset comprises 122K narrative documents, sourced from plot descriptions of diverse movies and TV episodes, along with their corresponding abstractive summaries.\nThe paper suggests that verifiability, i.e., the consistency of the generated text with factual knowledge, is a suitable metric for measuring this cost. Based on this, the authors propose a new generation strategy for producing non-repetitive and more verifiable text.\nThis study introduces the novel problem of social context summarization for web documents, aiming to generate summaries by considering both sentence informativeness and interests of social users. The authors propose a dual wing factor graph (DWFG) model which utilizes the mutual reinforcement between web documents and their associated social contexts to generate summaries.\nThe authors propose MediaSum - a large-scale media interview dataset consisting of 463.6K transcripts with abstractive summaries collected from NPR and CNN, employing their overview and topic descriptions as summaries.\nThe authors introduce a new dataset called RNSum, containing approximately 82,000 English release notes and associated commit messages from GitHub.

The abstractive explainer is trained in a semi-supervised manner, starting from the supervised model and then further training it through trial and error, maximizing a conciseness-promoted reward function.\nThe authors introduce the fractal summarization model, which captures important information from the source text using the hierarchical structure and salient features of the document, and produces a condensed version of the document using the contractive transformation in the fractal theory."

The model uses Gaussian Hidden Markov Model and Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for entity detection and type prediction, and a reinforcement learning-based instance selector for distinguishing positive sentences from noisy ones.\nThis paper proposes a unified framework that can handle both flat and nested NER tasks by formulating NER as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task rather than a sequence labeling problem.\nThis paper proposes Near-Negative Distinction (NND), a new and simple automatic evaluation method for NLG, that repurposes prior human annotations into NND tests to evaluate the performance of a model. In an NND test, an NLG model must place a higher likelihood on a high-quality output candidate than on a near-negative candidate with a known error.\nThe authors propose to leverage Entity Resolution (ER) features in NLU reranking and introduce a novel loss term based on ER signals to optimize model weights in the reranking framework. Additionally, for multi-domain dialog scenarios, a score distribution matching method is proposed to calibrate the scores generated by the NLU reranking models for different domains."

They design and implement a prototype, CoProtector, which uses data poisoning techniques to arm source code repositories for defense.\nThe authors propose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks called Finite Aggregation. Unlike DPA which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, Finite Aggregation first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers.\nThis study investigates and categorizes reward-poisoning attacks based on the infinity-norm constraint, providing infeasible attack's lower threshold and feasible attack's upper threshold. The authors highlight the underexplored area of adaptive attacks which depend not only on the state and action but also on the RL agent's learning process.\nThe study addresses the worst-case scenario of data poisoning attacks by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of attacks, for defenses employing first an outlier removal step followed by empirical risk minimization.\nThis paper proposes innovative priors such as diversity and topological simplicity to identify and improve the quality of potential triggers in Trojaned models.\nThis paper proposes CLPA, a novel clean-label approach for poisoning availability attacks, suggesting that due to intrinsic imperfections of classifiers, naturally misclassified inputs could be considered as a unique type of poisoned data, referred to as 'natural poisoned data'.\nThe authors propose the Lethal Dose Conjecture which states that if 'n' clean training samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-'N' training set, only \u0398(N/n) poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy. The conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal.\nThe authors propose a lightweight defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in FL which involves carefully adjusting the aggregation server's learning rate per dimension and per round based on the sign information of agents' updates.\nThe authors propose an efficient defense mechanism against various data poisoning attacks that provides theoretical performance guarantees and reduces the success rate of such attacks. They note that effective poisons move away from their original class and get isolated in the gradient space, suggesting that dropping examples in low-density gradient regions can eliminate effective poisons.\nThis paper proposes a client-based defense, FL-WBC (White Blood Cell for Federated Learning), to mitigate the impact of model poisoning attacks. The approach identifies the parameter space where long-lasting attack effects on parameters reside and disrupts that space during local learning.\nThis work is the first to study the risk of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures, highlighting a potential vulnerability in which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) upon which the model is trained has a cascading effect on multiple data values.\nThis study presents a novel equivalence between Byzantine gradient attacks, where workers report arbitrary gradients, and data poisoning, a scenario where input data is altered maliciously by workers.\nThe study examines a security threat to RL, where an attacker poisons the environment to force the agent to execute a specific policy chosen by the attacker, either by manipulating rewards or transition dynamics in a stealthy manner.\nIn this paper, the authors investigate a new type of data poisoning exploitation that increases the risk of privacy leakage of benign training samples. They focus on amplifying and exposing the membership of targeted classes through two proposed attacks: a generic dirty-label attack for supervised classification algorithms and an optimization-based clean-label attack in transfer learning scenarios.\nThe study proposes migrating backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explores the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation.\nThe authors suggest that poisoning attacks introduce localized high-loss regions, and thereby propose a two-component approach to alleviate these sharp loss regions. This approach involves the use of an optimized friendly noise to maximally perturb examples without degrading performance, and a randomly varying noise component."

They establish conditions under which OGDA exhibits concrete last-iterate convergence rates with a constant learning rate.\nThis work proposes the application of the alternating gradient descent ascent (AGDA) algorithm for a subclass of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives that satisfy a two-sided Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz inequality, with the claim that it converges globally at a linear rate.\nThe paper proposes a novel algorithm called Directly Accelerated stochastic Variance reductIon (DAVIS) with two Snapshots for non-strongly convex (non-SC) unconstrained problems. The algorithm uses double compensation and snapshots to close the convergence gap.\nThe paper suggests a new Decentralized stochastic algorithm with Variance Reduction, labelled as DVR. The key idea is to use Bregman coordinate descent on a well-chosen dual problem, and convert it to a dual-free approach using a specific Bregman divergence.\nThis paper presents a principled optimization framework, ZO-Min-Max, combining a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimator with an alternating projected stochastic gradient descent-ascent method, which only need a small number of function queries and a single descent/ascent update.\nThe authors propose a novel family of algorithms known as block-greedy coordinate descent, which includes several existing algorithms such as SCD, Greedy CD, Shotgun, and Thread-Greedy.\nThe study focuses on an overhaul on the understanding of Random Reshuffling by removing the previously asserted conditions for faster convergence. Additionally, it introduces a new variance type to improve RR's performance, presents results for non-strongly convex and non-convex objectives, and examines the fast convergence of the Shuffle-Once (SO) algorithm.\nThis paper presents an argument that, for two popular algorithms, SARSA(0) and V(0), the worst that can happen is oscillation within a bounded region, rather than divergence of weights.\nThe authors propose distributed algorithms based on dual averaging of subgradients for decentralized optimization over a network, with a unique property of separating the convergence of the optimization algorithm from the effects of communication constraints arising from the network structure.\nThe authors propose two averaging techniques for strongly convex optimization: Gradient Descent Averaging (GDA), a general projection-based dual averaging algorithm, and Strongly Convex-Primal-Dual Averaging (SC-PDA), where primal and dual averaging schemes are simultaneously used.\nThe authors presented a comprehensive theoretical analysis of variance reduced zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, a new variance reduced ZO algorithm called ZO-SVRG, and an experimental evaluation of this approach in the context of black-box chemical material classification and generation of adversarial examples from black-box deep neural network models.\nThe authors propose a generic framework for parallel coordinate descent (CD) algorithms, and introduce two novel parallel algorithms: Thread-Greedy CD and Coloring-Based CD."

Additionally, an algorithm is proposed to perform an online adjustment to the weight between the labeled real data and the generated data.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it.\nThe authors propose a new adversarial training approach for robustness over an unseen test domain that is not i.i.d. but deviates from the training domain. The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nThe authors suggest a connection between the adversarial robustness of a model and the number of tasks it is trained on, proposing that models trained on multiple tasks at once can be more robust to adversarial attacks on individual tasks.\nThe authors propose adversarial domain augmentation as a novel solution for the OOD generalization problem. The technique involves using adversarial training to create 'fictitious' yet 'challenging' populations, from which a model can learn to generalize with theoretical guarantees.\nThe authors propose a novel robust adversarial training approach that dynamically generates adversarial examples based on currently model's parameters and uses them for further training in an iterative schedule to improve the robustness of MRC models.\nTo tackle the vulnerability of models to adversarial attacks, the authors propose Ensemble Adversarial Training, a methodology that enriches training data with perturbations transferred from other models.\nThe authors propose adversarial post-specialization, a new method of specializing the full distributional vocabulary, that exploits words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global specialization function, combining standard L2-distance loss with adversarial loss for more realistic output vectors.\nThe authors focus on promoting adversarial robustness in MAML and proposed a general but easily-optimized robustness-regularized meta-learning framework which can use unlabeled data augmentation, fast adversarial attack generation, and computationally-light fine-tuning.\nThis study analyses the perturbation on the input of the generator and its influence on the generated images, and proposes a smooth generator that investigates the tolerable input perturbation.\nThe authors point out that standard adversarial training methods that focus on fickle adversarial examples can make a model more vulnerable to obstinate adversarial examples. Toward this, they propose Balanced Adversarial Training, incorporating contrastive learning to increase robustness against both types of adversarial examples.\nIn this work, larger bounds for adversarial robustness are explored, specifically against perturbations that may be perceptible but do not change human predictions. A novel defense, Oracle-Aligned Adversarial Training (OA-AT), is proposed to align the network's predictions with an Oracle during adversarial training.\nThe study proposes a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. This method aims to improve model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and teaches models to make predictions based on significant words. It also addresses the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms.\nThe authors propose a model-agnostic method that generates adversarially sampled data based on the few support samples, and fine-tunes the embedding space of a base classifier in a manner that increases the classification margins of these adversarial samples, making the classifier more robust.\nThe authors propose a regularization method that involves generating adversarial examples by perturbing the word embedding matrix of the model and performing contrastive learning on clean and adversarial examples to teach the model to learn noise-invariant representations.\nThe authors develop a theoretical model to analyze how adversarial training aids transfer learning and propose that adversarial training in the source data generates provably better representations, increasing the accuracy of the target data predictor when fine-tuned on this representation.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThe authors find that adversarially robust models, although less accurate overall, outperform traditionally-trained models when used for transfer learning."

In this approach, a smaller student model learns to rank items from both the training data and the guidance of a larger teacher model.\nThis paper proposes dynamic knowledge distillation, a new method that allows the student model to adjust the learning procedure based on its competency, thereby improving student performance and learning efficiency.\nThis paper introduces a novel alternating knowledge distillation approach for CPL. The approach exploits both content- and graph-based models to handle cases when some concepts are not discovered during training.\nThis work introduces a novel framework, 'prune, then distill', that first prunes the teacher model to make it more transferrable, then distills this knowledge to the student model.\nThe authors identify a problem they call 'imbalanced training', wherein final models pay more attention to recently exposed samples than earlier ones during static training. To address this, they propose a concept called Complementary Online Knowledge Distillation (COKD) that uses dynamically updated teacher models to provide complementary knowledge to the student model.\nThe authors introduce the idea of augmenting distillation with a third objective - the Interchange Intervention Training (IIT) which encourages the student model to imitate the causal computation process of the teacher model.\nThe authors extend the idea of knowledge distillation by allowing the training of a student model that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, taking advantage of not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher for better training and final performance.\nThe authors propose a 'Distill the Virtual Examples' (DiVE) method to tackle the long-tailed visual recognition problem, by treating the predictions of a teacher model as virtual examples.\nThe authors propose a novel scheme named Cross-Modal Knowledge Generalization. This trains the Student in a Target dataset where the Teacher is unavailable, by generalizing the distilled cross-modal knowledge learned from a Source dataset to the Target dataset by modeling knowledge as priors on parameters of the Student.\nThe paper introduces and investigates a concept called Nasty Teacher, a specially trained network that operates almost similar to a normal model but considerably degrades the performance of student models that attempt to imitate it. The authors propose a simple algorithm to build the Nasty Teacher, called self-undermining knowledge distillation.\nThe authors propose a novel knowledge distillation approach that aims to learn the teacher models that are more student-friendly and hence more appropriate for knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose a method called negative distillation. This involves introducing a negative teacher model that can produce query-wise generic responses, and then the student model is required to maximize the distance with multi-level negative knowledge.\nThe authors' preliminary study revealed that not all extracted knowledge is essential for training a good student model and that specific knowledge is beneficial at different training steps. Therefore, they propose an actor-critic method to select the appropriate knowledge for transfer during the distillation process.\nThe authors propose a novel training policy called Long Short-Term Sample Distillation that leverages both long-term and short-term teaching signals from previous training phases. The long-term signal provides guidance and teacher\u2013student differences while the short-term signal provides up-to-date cues for better updates.\nThe authors propose a simple knowledge distillation technique that directly reuses the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference. Feature alignment with a single \u21132 loss is used to train the student encoder.\nThe paper presents a model distillation method, referred to as 'structural model distillation', which allows memory reduction without needing to redesign the architecture; the method uses a student architecture that is a simple transformation of the teacher architecture and can use the same hyperparameters.\nThe authors present a novel method for knowledge distillation that optimizes the output feature of the penultimate layer of the student network. This method decouples representation learning and classification, using the teacher's pre-trained classifier to train the student's penultimate layer feature.\nThe authors propose a novel approach to knowledge distillation that uses a more intrinsic measure, leveraging global knowledge formed by the representations of instances with respect to a group of common basis vectors in the feature spaces of both the student and teacher models. This is achieved through a novel prototype generation module (PGM) that finds these common basis vectors, or prototypes, and a robust distilling module (RDM) that constructs the global knowledge and filters noisy local knowledge.\nThe authors propose a distillation technique for 'skeptical students', models that reduce a teacher's influence by learning from a shallow sub-section of the teacher's knowledge, enabling them to learn even from a nasty teacher.\nThe researchers propose a novel KD method that overcomes existing limitations by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and training a student model to mimic this flow."

The model doesn't have access to data from the test domain but has a broad specification about the types of perturbations in terms of attributes.\nContrary to the conventional wisdom that more training data will help close the generalization gap between adversarially-trained models and standard models, the authors propose that increasing the amount of data may actually widen this gap.\nThe authors introduce the Targeted Adversarial Training (TAT) algorithm which improves model accuracy by introspecting current mistakes and prioritising adversarial training steps where the model makes the most errors.\nThe authors propose a method known as Confidence-Calibrated Adversarial Training (CCAT), which biases the model towards making low confidence predictions on adversarial examples, thereby allowing it to reject examples with low confidence and achieve greater robustness beyond the threat model used during training.\nThis paper proposes an approach called collaborative adversarial training to improve data utilization in DS-MIL RE by coordinating virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at different levels.\nThe authors propose to use domain expertise to identify statistically predictive but legally irrelevant information and adopt adversarial training to prevent the system from relying on it."

This model is further equipped with novel multi-modal feature fusion techniques and attention mechanisms, specifically designed to generate named entities more accurately.\nThe authors introduce a new large-scale multilingual video description dataset called VATEX, which is more diverse and linguistically complex.   They also propose two new tasks for video-and-language research: Multilingual Video Captioning and Video-guided Machine Translation.\nThe authors propose a new multi-source synopsis framework that correlates visual data with non-visual auxiliary information, aiming to better describe and summarise events in complex scenes.   This model is capable of uncovering latent correlations among different types of data sources, even in cases of heteroscedasticity and dimensionality discrepancy.\nThe authors propose an unsupervised image captioning method that generates language descriptions of scenes from images.   This is achieved through a shared latent space structured by visual concepts, where image features can be translated into this embedding space and decoded into descriptions through a language model.\nThe authors propose a practical extension beyond one-step generation - a recurrent image generation model that generates an image iteratively conditioned on ongoing linguistic input or feedback."

The model takes an image-question-answer triplet as input and predicts whether the combination is correct.\nThe authors propose a framework and a novel top-down calibration technique for disentangling the reasoning aspect of VQA from its perception.  They introduce a differentiable first-order logic formalism for VQA that explicitly separates question answering from visual perception.\nThe authors propose a method that exploits a set of external off-the-shelf algorithms, along with a new co-attention model, to answer questions in VQA.  The method also generates human-readable reasons for its decisions and can be trained end-to-end without requiring ground truth reasons.\nThe authors propose a novel VQA model that generates its own questions to actively obtain auxiliary perceptual information useful for reasoning correctly.
