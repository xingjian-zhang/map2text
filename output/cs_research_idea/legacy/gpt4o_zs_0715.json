It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThe paper explores the possibility of model poisoning for backdoor attacks by leveraging the rarely utilized word embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and introduces a new method specific to federated learning called Gradient Ensemble.\nThe authors propose a scheme to detect and mitigate sample-targeted backdoor attacks. They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThis paper demonstrates the feasibility of a targeted attack on black-box NMT systems by poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data.\nThis paper proposes a practical data poisoning attack approach, LOKI, against blackbox recommendation systems under the general next-item recommendation setting. LOKI uses reinforcement learning to train an attack agent who generates user behavior samples for data poisoning, interacting with a recommender simulator to bypass the high cost of retraining models and user-interaction frequency restrictions.\nA stronger weight-poisoning attack method is proposed. This method introduces a layerwise weight poisoning strategy to plant deeper undetectable backdoors with a combinatorial trigger.\nThe authors propose two new types of data poisoning attacks where an adversary intentionally targets the system's fairness. The attacks are known as the anchoring attack and the influence attack on fairness, targeting fairness measures by skewing the decision boundary or maximizing the covariance between sensitive attributes and decision outcome respectively.\nThe paper proposes a novel approach, TDSSA (Truth Discovery against Strategic Sybil Attack), to defend against strategic Sybil attacks that attempt to evade traditional detection methods.\nThe authors introduce a model-based reinforcement learning framework that can orchestrate untargeted poisoning attacks against federated learning systems by approximating the distribution of the clients' aggregated data.\nThe authors propose adversarial poisoning training (APT) which simulates the poisoning process by introducing fake users known as ERM users dedicated to minimizing empirical risk, in order to build a robust system.\nThis paper introduces Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that increases the durability of backdoors in Federated Learning systems by attacking parameters that are less frequently altered during training.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the gradients of regular and malicious data on the model."

CSG-Stump, a core part of the system, simplifies the complex tree structures of traditional CSG and is deep-learning friendly.\nThe researchers propose a novel point cloud representation that is mathematically proven to be rigorously rotation-invariant, which produces unique and consistent representations for identical point clouds in different orientations. The proposed representation is also conditional information-lossless, retaining all necessary information of point cloud except for orientation information.\nThis study introduces a Teacher-Student Multimodal Fusion (TSMF) model that fuses skeleton and RGB modalities at the model level for indoor action recognition.

The method uses SDVs computed per interest point and aligns them to the local reference frame for rotation invariance.\nAuthors propose an efficient and holistic pipeline, 3R-Depth, that deeply integrates an efficient 3D shape estimator with existing recognition (e.g., ResNets) and segmentation (e.g., MaskR-CNN) techniques, thereby allowing it to simultaneously learn the semantics and structure of a scene from a single depth image.\nThe authors introduce ExtrudeNet, an unsupervised end-to-end network that can discover sketch and extrude from point clouds. The key features of ExtrudeNet are a new representation for sketch and extrude and a novel numerical method for computing the signed distance field used in network learning.\nThe authors introduce PPF-FoldNet, an unsupervised learning approach for extracting 3D local descriptors on point cloud geometry, based on the folding-based auto-encoding of well-known point pair features, which offers rotation invariance, benefits from point-set sparsity, and does not require a sensitive local reference frame.\nThis paper introduces a new paradigm for computing high fidelity implicit neural representations directly from raw data (e.g., point clouds). The authors propose a simple loss function that encourages the neural network to vanish on the input point cloud and to have a unit norm gradient.\nThis paper presents a deep neural net, named multi-view perceptron (MVP), that can separate the identity and view features from a single 2D face image and can also generate a full spectrum of multi-view images from the same.\nThis work proposes a novel deep neural network, FlowNet3D, that learns scene flow from point clouds in an end-to-end manner.

This network directly samples the original point cloud at different resolutions.\nA unified framework is proposed to streamline neural architectures for 3D point clouds, with the main innovation being the factorization of neural networks into a series of view transforms and neural layers. This enables a fair comparison of existing work and exploration of new designs.\nThe key idea is the 3DNN (3D Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm, which matches an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint of the image. It also automatically generates detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image and transfers information across images to label and segment objects in a scene.\nA deep learning architecture is presented which introduces grouping techniques to define point neighborhoods in the initial world space and the learned feature space. Additionally, dedicated loss functions, namely the pairwise distance loss and the centroid loss, are incorporated to further structure the learned point feature space.\nThis paper proposes an algorithm for analysis of pointwise robustness of neural networks that operate on 3D data.\nThe researchers propose a novel system, PointLIE, an approach to adaptive point cloud sampling and recovery.

The method uses an embedding graph to capture semantic connections between pseudo OOD samples and IND intents.\nThe main idea of this research is to mitigate the simplicity bias and improve OOD generalization by training a group of similar models to fit data in multiple ways. They achieve this through the use of a penalty on the alignment of models' input gradients. By doing so, this induces the learning of more complex predictive patterns.\nThe authors propose a principled and practical method for OoD detection with deep hybrid models (DHMs), which model the joint density of features and labels with a single forward pass. It factorizes the joint density into three sources of uncertainty.\nThe authors propose a new theoretical probabilistic framework for OOD detection in deep classification networks which uses two regularization constraints designed to calibrate and estimate sample density to identify OOD.\nThe authors propose a two-step procedure for improving OoD detection. Firstly, they introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on OoD samples, utilizing COCO dataset samples as OoD proxy. Secondly, they introduce 'meta classification' to discard false positive OoD samples by applying linear models to hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities.\nThis paper investigates the potential reasons for the mixed performance results associated with using CAD for OOD generalization. It suggests that even though features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust, it might prevent the model from learning other robust features, and CAD could reinforce existing spurious correlations in the data.\nThe paper proposes a generalized OOD detection method that is independent of out-of-distribution datasets, relying on self-supervised feature learning of the training samples, where the embeddings lie on a compact low-dimensional space.\nThe research concludes that this unexpected behavior of DGMs should be attributed to model misestimation rather than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions of interest.\nThe authors introduce a framework named E^3Outlier, designed for UOD that leverages a discriminative deep neural network (DNN) for better representation learning, using surrogate supervision to create multiple pseudo classes from original unlabelled data. It employs a new approach known as inlier priority, which prioritizes minimizing inliers' loss, to enable end-to-end UOD by discriminative DNN.\nThe authors introduce a new OOD score, called a locally most powerful Bayesian test (LMPBT), that is designed to maximize the probability of correctly detecting OOD samples under specified conditions.\nThe authors formulate two problems associated with graph data -- debiased learning and OOD detection, and propose a unified probabilistic model to tackle them, which includes modeling the graph's generative process and an additional latent environment variable as an indicator."

The method is based on a new contrastive objective that is inspired by the sparsest cut problem and includes a Laplacian smoothing trick to solve the underlying optimization problem.\nThe authors devise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to enhance contrastive learning. They also introduce a visualization scheme for positive and negative score distribution to analyze, interpret, and understand the learning process.\nThe paper introduces a new family of adversarial examples for contrastive learning and uses these examples to define a new adversarial training algorithm for SSL, known as CLAE.\nThe authors propose a new model named Critical Semantic-Consistent Learning (CSCL) that reduces discrepancies in both domain-wise and category-wise distributions, by highlighting transferable domain-wise knowledge and neglecting untransferable ones.\nThe authors introduce an alternative approach to few-shot segmentations based on contrastive learning, contrasting with the popular GAN-based understandings.\nThe authors propose Relative Predictive Coding (RPC), a new contrastive representation learning objective. RPC introduces relative parameters to regularize the objective for boundedness and low variance, and unlike prior approaches, does not use logarithm and exponential score functions.\nThe study proposes a theoretical argument that the representation matrix learned by contrastive learning boosts robustness through two properties: one prominent singular value for each sub-class in the data and a large alignment between the prominent singular vectors and the clean labels of each sub-class.\nThe authors propose a unifying framework for learning contrastive representations of stochastic processes (CReSP) that does not require exact reconstruction.\nIn this study, a detailed analysis of the feature learning process of contrastive learning is presented, focusing on two types of features: semantically aligned sparse features to learn from, and dense features to avoid. A principle called feature decoupling is also introduced.\nThe study proposes a novel way to leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate target feature learning, with an online pseudo labeling scheme with refinement that significantly reduces noise in pseudo labels. They execute the contrastive learning task simultaneously with pseudo labeling, following a scheme similar to MoCo but with a source-initialized encoder.\nThis paper presents a general method that mitigates these two problems by considering where and what to contrast in a general contrastive learning framework. It proposes learning different augmentation invariances at varying depths of the model and expanding the contrast content with augmentation embeddings to lessen the misleading effects of strong data augmentations.\nThe paper proposes a Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Learning (SPCL) loss for the ERC task, which uses the Prototypical Network to address the imbalanced classification problem through contrastive learning, without requiring a large batch size.\nA class-contrastive framework is proposed for explaining deep neural networks. This framework seeks to identify features with class-discriminative power, answering the question 'why is the input classified into this class, but not others?'.\nA contrastive learning approach is proposed where the neural network identifies the divergence of patterns in MWPs.

The authors propose an Interpolative Distillation (InterD) framework, which interpolates the biased and unbiased models at the user-item pair level by distilling a student model.\nThe authors propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework called Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB) which rearranges sequential sampling to constrain half of each mini-batch to coincide with the previous and subsequent iterations thereby guiding training stability and consistency.\nThe authors propose a new method for KD where only a limited number of unlabeled training samples and a black-box teacher are at disposal. The core idea is to generate a diverse set of out-of-distribution synthetic images using MixUp and a conditional variational auto-encoder to expand the training dataset.\nThe authors propose a comprehensive, interventional distillation (CID) method that captures both sample and class representations while removing bias through causal intervention. The softened logits, typically used as training targets, are considered as context information to eliminate biased knowledge.\nTSPipe, a pipelined approach, is proposed to accelerate the training process of any teacher-student frameworks including Knowledge distillation (KD) and self-supervised learning (SSL). The main idea involves scheduling the computation of the teacher and student network separately, and fully utilizing the GPU during training by interleaving the computations of the two networks and relaxing their dependencies.\nThe authors suggest combining low precision numerics and knowledge distillation - a method they call 'Apprentice' - to improve the performance of low precision networks.\nThe authors developed a two-phase pipeline leveraging self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization ability of CNNs for image classification. The first phase involves learning a teacher model through self-supervised learning, and the second phase is distilling the representations into a student model and fine-tuning the model for the image classification task.\nThe authors propose the adaptive sample weighting to KD, called Prime-Aware Adaptive Distillation (PAD) that incorporates uncertainty learning. PAD is able to identify prime samples in distillation and adjust their effect adaptively.\nThe authors propose a novel framework named Safe Distillation Box (SDB) which protects the intellectual property of pre-trained models by allowing inference ability to all users but restricting knowledge distillation to only authorized users.\nThe authors present a new method called Peer Collaborative Learning for online knowledge distillation, which combines online ensembling and network collaboration into a singular framework. It creates a multi-branch network for training where each branch is considered a 'peer'. The strategy also uses random augmentation multiple times on the inputs to peers to improve knowledge transfer.\nThe authors propose MixKD, a data-agnostic distillation framework that utilizes Mixup, a data augmentation technique. MixKD enables the student model to mimic the behavior of the teacher model not only on original training examples but also on linear interpolations of example pairs.\nThe authors propose a new distillation strategy for unsupervised learning called BINGO (Bag of InstaNces aGgregatiOn). The method emphasizes the importance of relationships among similar samples and aims to transfer these relationships, learned by the teacher model, to the student model.\nThis paper proposes an innovative self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge between distorted versions of the same training data. This mechanism is designed to bypass the need for accompanying models, instead focusing on learning consistent global feature distributions and posterior distributions across these distorted versions.\nTheir approach introduces a self-supervised learning algorithm where a soft similarity is used for negative images rather than a binary distinction. Using iterative similarity distillation, a slowly evolving teacher model is distilled to the student model by transferring the similarity of a query image to random images.\nThis paper proposes an online knowledge distillation method that transfers knowledge of both class probabilities and the feature map using the adversarial training framework.\nThe authors propose a new training procedure for multi-exit architectures based on the principle of knowledge distillation, which encourages early exits to match the probability outputs of later, more accurate exits.\nThe authors propose Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-distillation (S2SD), an extension to DML, that leverages knowledge distillation from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces during training while maintaining test-time cost.\nThe authors propose a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) that blends the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one.\nThe authors propose a method to distill knowledge from a deep pose regressor network by using teacher loss as a confidence score, and assigning variable importance to the teacher prediction.

They propose to first learn on-policy about the data-generating behavior, and then bootstrap an off-policy value estimate on this policy, constructing a value estimate that is partially off-policy.\nThe authors propose a unified perspective to better understand policy optimization methods. This perspective re-expresses the underlying updates in terms of a limited choice of gradient form and scaling function, offering a parameterized space of approximate gradient updates for policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel approach called constraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO) that operates differently from many popular SRL algorithms. CRPO alternates between improving objectives and satisfying constraints during policy updates.\nThis paper introduces the Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an 'optimistic version' of the policy gradient direction, to address the issue of incorporating exploration in policy optimization.\nThe authors propose a novel policy optimization method called Constrained Update Projection (CUP), which provides rigorous safety guarantees. CUP is developed using newly proposed surrogate functions and performance bounds.\nThe authors introduce a non-parametric policy gradient approach, NPPG, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods. The key strategy is the use of Friedmann's gradient boosting, where policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models built in a stage-wise optimization.\nThis paper proposes a meta-algorithm for the statistically efficient estimation of policy gradients from off-policy data.\nThe authors propose that the state value baseline allows on-policy stochastic natural policy gradient (NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an O(1/t) rate and argue against the commonly believed idea that the primary function of baselines is to reduce variance of the natural policy gradient estimates.\nThe authors present Taylor Expansion Policy Optimization (TEPO), a new formalism for policy optimization, that generalizes previous works by incorporating Taylor expansions.\nThe paper introduces a method for stabilizing policy optimization when off-policy data is being reused. This involves the inclusion of a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that is generating the data and the current policy, which assures small and safe updates with off-policy data.\nConstrained Policy Optimization (CPO), a new general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning, is proposed. The algorithm has guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration and allows for training neural network policies for high-dimensional control while ensuring safety throughout training.\nThe paper proposes a mechanism to interpolate between a direct value estimate and a projected value estimate, computed from the reward and previous estimates. This approach reduces the need to learn about discontinuities, and thus potentially improves value function approximation.\nThe authors propose a fully decentralized and sample-efficient stochastic policy extragradient algorithm for solving tabular zero-sum Markov games, which uses multiple stochastic estimators to estimate the value functions involved in the stochastic updates and employs entropy regularization to boost convergence.\nThis paper proposes the concept of Characteristic Value Function (CVF), the frequency domain representation of the probability distribution of returns in reinforcement learning. Instead of representing a probability distribution function of returns, they propose to represent their characteristic function, which is the Fourier transform of their distribution.\nThe authors propose a method called Direct Advantage Estimation (DAE) that can model the advantage function directly from on-policy data, minimizing the variance of the return, without necessitating the (action-)value function.\nIn view of the success of ensemble methods in supervised learning on accuracy and generalization, the authors propose a new method: Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which employs ensemble policies in an end-to-end fashion. EPPO notably integrates each policy with the policy ensemble and optimizes both together, and employs a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space to improve generalization to unseen states and encourage exploration.\nThe authors introduce Constrained Offline Policy Optimization (COPO), an offline policy optimization algorithm built upon a novel offline cost-projection method. This is designed to improve the state-of-the-art in offline constrained policy optimization by explicitly considering distributional shifts.\nThe authors propose a new method called Value Function Factorization with Variable Agent Sub-Teams (VAST) that approximates a factorization for sub-teams, which can be defined in arbitrary ways and vary over time to adapt to different situations, thereby offering a more focused and compact input representation of the original VFF operator.\nThis paper introduces a Bayesian framework that employs approximate posterior distributions to model the uncertainty of the value function in reinforcement learning, using Wasserstein barycenters to propagate uncertainty across state-action pairs.\nThe authors propose a novel policy gradient-style robust optimization approach, PG-BROIL, that balances expected performance and risk by optimizing a soft-robust objective. This is the first policy optimization algorithm that is robust to a distribution of reward hypotheses and can scale to continuous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)."

                "content": "Predict new key idea based on these key ideas: The authors propose to resurrect sigmoid in deep learning by achieving dynamical isometry through orthogonal weight initialization in deep nonlinear networks, countering the prevalent use of ReLU networks.\nThe authors propose the idea of achieving successful deep learning with significantly fewer learnable parameters adapting to the target function, from an approximation perspective. They theorize that a ReLU network with a small number of intrinsic parameters can approximate any Lipschitz continuous function with an exponentially small error.\nThe authors propose a new approach called 'Analytic Marching', which uses the fact that a ReLU-based MLP creates linear regions in its input space. From these regions, the authors identify analytic cells and faces associated with the zero-level isosurface of the implicit function.\nThe authors propose the idea that there can be convergence to low robust training loss for neural networks of polynomial width under natural assumptions, using the ReLU activation function.\nThe authors propose to estimate the parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using a gradient descent algorithm combined with median- or trimmed mean-based filters to mitigate the effect of the arbitrary outliers.\nThe authors model the optimization of a ReLU network using a geometric and combinatoric object known as a zonotope, leading to an analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal loss to perturbations of the training data and new insights into zonotope vertex selection relevance to optimization.\nThe paper identifies natural settings where depth 2 ReLU networks trained with gradient flow are provably non-robust, even when robust networks that classify the training dataset correctly exist.\nThe authors propose an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to global optimality, and they establish new lower bounds on the size needed to approximate a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. They also construct a family of functions that scale exponentially with dimension.\nThis paper shows that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is limited by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. This limit, surprisingly, is independent of the depth of the network.\nThe researchers propose a study to prove that one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU networks of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can achieve competitive classification accuracy, even when data is corrupted by adversarial label noise.\nThe authors propose that the traditional requirement for each neural network layer to be larger than the previous can be replaced with a constant expansivity assumption, opposed to an exponential one. They also introduce the concept of 'pseudo-Lipschitzness'.\nThe authors proposed a training method using stochastic gradient descent for two-layer ReLU neural networks that demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks under specific conditions of separability in the RKHS induced by the infinite-width network.\nThis paper proposes a parametric framework named k-ReLU, which jointly approximates the output of multiple ReLUs in a layer. This allows the method to encapsulate dependencies between the inputs of different ReLUs, thus overcoming the convex barrier of single neuron relaxation.\nThe authors propose a novel methodology that applies a localized change in the function space for repairing ReLU networks. This methodology constructs a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input resides, which corrects the behavior on the buggy input when combined with the original network.\nThe authors propose that two-layer ReLU neural networks with random weights can be adversarially reprogrammed to achieve high accuracy on Bernoulli data models over hypercube vertices, provided the network width is no greater than its input dimension.\nThis work aims to characterize the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the $L^p$ functions, using networks with the ReLU activation functions, and also examines the same with an additional threshold activation function and networks with general activation functions.\nThe authors propose a new efficient method for the verification of ReLU-based neural networks that uses dependency relations between the ReLU nodes, to prune the search tree that needs to be considered by MILP-based formulations of the verification problem.\nThe authors counter the belief in exponentially increasing length distortion with network depth by proving the expected length distortion does not grow with depth, and indeed shrinks slightly, for ReLU networks with standard random initialization.\nThis research expands upon previous work by examining the effects of small perturbations of input vectors leading to large changes in outputs in ReLU networks of constant depth and a large range of widths, emphasizing the importance of bottleneck layers and arguing that these networks tend to compute functions that are locally very similar to random linear functions.\nThe authors propose fast algorithms and robust software for the convex optimization of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. They reformulate the standard weight-decay penalized training problem as a set of group-l1-regularized data-local models under polyhedral cone constraints."

They discover and demonstrate a unique property of the sample-targeted backdoor, which forces a boundary change such that small 'pockets' are formed around the target sample and propose a defense mechanism to pinpoint a malicious pocket by 'wrapping' them into a tight convex hull in the feature space.\nThe paper introduces a new neural backdoor attack, named 'Hibernated Backdoor', which remains in an inactive state to avoid detection until it's deployed and fine-tuned on end devices, where it becomes active and exploitable. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the gradients of regular and malicious data on the model.\nThis paper introduces Neurotoxin, a simple one-line backdoor attack that increases the durability of backdoors in Federated Learning systems by attacking parameters that are less frequently altered during training.\nThe paper introduces a $handcrafted$ attack that directly manipulates a model's weights. This direct modification gives the attacker more freedom compared to poisoning, and can be used to evade many backdoor detection or removal defenses effectively.\nThe authors propose a new strategy for textual backdoor attacks that does not require an external trigger and ensures that poisoned samples are correctly labeled. The basis of this strategy is the creation of clean-labeled examples, the labels of which are correct but can cause test label changes when combined with the training set.\nThe authors propose a poisoning attack, where a malicious adversary uses a small poisoned sample of monolingual text inserted into the training set to induce specific, targeted translation behavior like propagating misinformation.\nThis paper proposes a method for detecting backdoors in neural networks, assuming no prior knowledge about whether a model is poisoned or access to a clean sample set. It is based on observing contrasting channel-level statistics between poisoned and clean image features and distinguishing them through progressive channel shuffling.\nThe authors propose a new Model Poisoning Attack based on Fake clients (MPAF), where the attacker injects fake clients into a federated learning system and sends carefully crafted fake local model updates to the cloud server during training, such that the learned global model has low accuracy for many indiscriminate test inputs.\nThe study introduces TrialAttack, an end-to-end poisoning framework to generate unnoticeable yet harmful user profiles that balance imperceptibility and harmfulness through a triple adversarial learning mechanism involving a generator, a discriminator, and an influence module.\nThis paper presents a new type of stealthy backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon; reflection.

This is achieved by clustering the irregularly distributed weights into structured blocks via reordering the input/output dimension, and then structurally pruning them.\nTo improve the efficiency of network pruning, the authors propose entropy-based pruning, a new regularizer that can be integrated into existing network pruning algorithms. This approach, based on the insight that reducing the information entropy of the network outputs decreases the upper bound of the subsequent decoding search space, could address the slowdown caused by conventional pruning methods.\nThe paper intends to investigate the usefulness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms to alleviate the sparsity problem in CAVR, which is a relatively unexplored area.\nThe authors propose a framework for understanding the internal dynamics of continuous depth models by pruning their network architectures.\nThis paper challenges conventional beliefs by checking several recent unstructured pruning methods and finding that some of these methods hardly use the training data and modifying the preserved weights per layer randomly does not influence the final results.\nThe authors propose Movement Pruning, an adaptive, deterministic first-order weight pruning method that is more suited to fine-tuning pretrained models.\nThis paper bridges the gap between the model interpretability of sparse convolutional models and the empirical performance of deep neural networks. It does this by incorporating differentiable optimization layers defined from convolutional sparse coding as substitutes for standard convolutional layers in conventional deep neural networks.\nThe authors proposed DiSparse, a simple, effective, and first-of-its-kind multitask pruning and sparse training scheme that considers each task independently for disentangling the importance measurement and takes unanimous decisions among all tasks when performing parameter pruning and selection.\nThe authors argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. They formulate pruning as an optimization problem, casting the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and maximizing the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions.\nThe authors examine structured pruning on multilingual pre-trained language models, considering different settings, algorithms, and efficiency aspects, and present Dynamic Sparsification, an approach that allows training the model once and adapting to different model sizes at inference.\nThe authors introduce a network pruning based meta-learning approach with the aim of reducing overfitting by explicitly controlling the network capacity.\nThe paper introduces ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to derive a highly sparse network from an existing dense network. The Heaviside function is chosen due to its practical application in design optimization which also deals with material distribution as a discrete value optimization problem.\nThe authors introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, aiming to achieve easy and quick model compression. The toolkit offers structured post-training pruning methods and includes a new self-supervised pruning method that can be applied without labeled data.\nThe authors propose a new method that combines the benefits of both pre-training and post-training pruning. This method prunes as early as possible during training without affecting performance. The method uses initial dense training to guide the architecture, constantly evaluates dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking, and introduces an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) to trigger pruning when the architecture stabilizes.\nThe paper proposes a method called Prospect Pruning (ProsPr) that overcomes the limitation of existing methods by using meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. It integrates an estimate of the higher-order effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network.\nThe authors introduce a deep learning inference optimization pipeline which consists of model compression methods like Tensor Decomposition, Graph Adaptive Pruning, Intrinsic Sparse Structures in Long Short-Term Memory, Knowledge Distillation, and low-bit model quantization.\nThe authors propose two operations, pruning and growing, that exploit the discovered sparsity of PC structures. Pruning removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression, and growing increases model capacity by expanding the size of the latent space.\nIn this paper, the authors propose a technique called ADDEMUP that uses genetic algorithms to directly search for an accurate and diverse set of trained networks. This method creates an initial population, then uses genetic operators to generate new networks that are as accurate as possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible."

Instead of using diverse outliers or retraining the model, they rectify the feature into its typical set and calculate the OOD score using these typical features.\nThe authors propose CLOM, a unified approach based on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and task masking, to solve both TIL and CIL problems. The key novelty is that each task is trained as an OOD detection model rather than a traditional supervised learning model, and a task mask is trained to prevent forgetting.\nThe authors approach the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem in an OOD environment with user feature shifts from a causal view, formulating the user feature shift as an intervention and OOD recommendation as post-intervention inference of the interaction probability.\nA new set of benchmarks and an approach, semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD), is proposed that focuses on the inherent semantics of the data rather than the low-level discrepancies between data sources.\nThe authors introduce ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain-independent, rule-based EE framework that is simple, powerful, robust, and fast. It allows for the mixing of syntactic patterns with surface, token-based patterns in order to recover from syntactic parsing errors.\nThis study proposes a framework which uses wild mixture data, comprising both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Such data is abundant when a machine learning classifier is deployed in practical settings.\nThe authors provide a new formalization of OOD by modelling the data shifts, taking into account both the invariant and environmental (spurious) features. They explore how the spurious correlation in the training set impacts OOD detection.\nA new approach, Adaptive In-Out-aware Learning (AIOL), is proposed for OOD detection, which uses a temperature parameter to adaptive select potential ID and OOD samples from a mixed pool of unlabeled data. The approach also incorporates entropy over these samples. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are employed to account for OOD samples from unseen classes.\nThe authors propose a new OOD detection framework, MoodCat, that masks a random portion of the input image and utilizes a generative model to synthesize the masked image into a new image based on the classification result, and then computes the semantic discrepancy between the original and synthesized image for OOD detection.\nThe authors propose a multi-task curriculum learning framework that instead of training an OOD detector and SSL separately, integrates the detection of OOD samples in unlabeled data into the learning process.\nThe authors propose MetaOD, a data-driven approach to UOMS based on meta-learning. This model uses the performances of many detection models on historical outlier detection datasets to automatically choose an effective model for a new dataset without any labels, evaluations, or comparisons.\nThe authors propose a novel training mechanism that exploits the presence of OOD data for improved feature learning while avoiding its ill-effect on SSL. This is achieved by introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including OOD, performing a pretext task and a cross-modal matching strategy to detect OOD samples.\nThis paper presents two key ideas: one is the proposal of an alteration to the model training process to mitigate the OOD problem, and the other is the introduction of four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations.\nThe authors propose ODIN, a simple method for detecting out-of-distribution images that doesn't require modifications to a pre-trained neural network, based on the idea of using temperature scaling and adding small input perturbations to separate softmax score distributions of in-distribution and out-of-distribution images.\nThis study challenges the standard view, showing that full fine-tuning can result in poorer out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy than linear probing when pretrained features are high in quality and the distribution shift is large.\nThe authors propose an analytical framework for understanding OOD detection. This framework motivates a novel OOD detection method for neural networks called GEM, which shows both theoretical and empirical superiority.\nThe suggested method follows four design principles to address existing limitations: decoupling OOD detection from segmentation, observing the entire segmentation network rather than just its output, generating training data for the OOD detector from blind spots in the segmentation network, and localizing the generated data to simulate OOD objects.\nThis study sets out to define 1) what is considered OOD; 2) what it means for an OOD problem to be learnable. In addition, the authors introduce a new concept of expansion function, thereby giving a quantitative meaning to invariant features.\nThe authors propose a novel framework, Boundary Aware Learning (BAL), that can adaptively learn the distribution of OOD features. BAL uses a generator to produce OOD features progressively from trivial to hard, and a discriminator is trained to separate these synthetic OOD features from in-distribution (ID) features."

Unlike DPA which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, Finite Aggregation first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers.\nThis study investigates and categorizes reward-poisoning attacks based on the infinity-norm constraint, providing infeasible attack's lower threshold and feasible attack's upper threshold. The authors highlight the underexplored area of adaptive attacks which depend not only on the state and action but also on the RL agent's learning process.\nThe study addresses the worst-case scenario of data poisoning attacks by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of attacks, for defenses employing first an outlier removal step followed by empirical risk minimization.\nThis paper proposes innovative priors such as diversity and topological simplicity to identify and improve the quality of potential triggers in Trojaned models.\nThis paper proposes CLPA, a novel clean-label approach for poisoning availability attacks, suggesting that due to intrinsic imperfections of classifiers, naturally misclassified inputs could be considered as a unique type of poisoned data, referred to as 'natural poisoned data'.\nThe authors propose the Lethal Dose Conjecture which states that if 'n' clean training samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-'N' training set, only \u0398(N/n) poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy. The conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal.\nThe authors propose a lightweight defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in FL which involves carefully adjusting the aggregation server's learning rate per dimension and per round based on the sign information of agents' updates.\nThe authors propose an efficient defense mechanism against various data poisoning attacks that provides theoretical performance guarantees and reduces the success rate of such attacks. They note that effective poisons move away from their original class and get isolated in the gradient space, suggesting that dropping examples in low-density gradient regions can eliminate effective poisons.\nThis paper proposes a client-based defense, FL-WBC (White Blood Cell for Federated Learning), to mitigate the impact of model poisoning attacks. The approach identifies the parameter space where long-lasting attack effects on parameters reside and disrupts that space during local learning.\nThis work is the first to study the risk of data poisoning attacks on learned index structures, highlighting a potential vulnerability in which the cumulative distribution function (CDF) upon which the model is trained has a cascading effect on multiple data values.\nThis study presents a novel equivalence between Byzantine gradient attacks, where workers report arbitrary gradients, and data poisoning, a scenario where input data is altered maliciously by workers.\nThe study examines a security threat to RL, where an attacker poisons the environment to force the agent to execute a specific policy chosen by the attacker, either by manipulating rewards or transition dynamics in a stealthy manner.\nIn this paper, the authors investigate a new type of data poisoning exploitation that increases the risk of privacy leakage of benign training samples. They focus on amplifying and exposing the membership of targeted classes through two proposed attacks: a generic dirty-label attack for supervised classification algorithms and an optimization-based clean-label attack in transfer learning scenarios.\nThe study proposes migrating backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explores the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation.\nThe authors suggest that poisoning attacks introduce localized high-loss regions, and thereby propose a two-component approach to alleviate these sharp loss regions.

Furthermore, the authors present OSCAR, a hierarchical Transformer-based pre-training model to facilitate the understanding of programs.\nThe authors propose further extensions to LM-BFF, namely LM-BFF-MS, which includes prompts with multiple demonstrations based on automatic generation of multiple label words, and soft demonstration memory which consists of multiple sequences of globally shared word embeddings for a similar context.\nThe authors propose UniCRS, a unified CRS model, based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning. This approach combines the recommendation and conversation subtasks into the prompt learning paradigm, using knowledge-enhanced prompts based on a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM).\nThis study proposes a multi-stage prompting approach that leverages the inherent knowledge stored in the pretrained LM and its generation ability. The approach uses the pretrained language model to generate knowledge based on the dialogue context and then prompt it further to generate responses from the previously generated knowledge.\nThe authors introduced the idea of 0-shot prompts that outperform few-shot prompts in the GPT-3 model. They propose a broader theory of prompt programming that utilizes narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions, and deconstructs a problem into components before delivering a verdict.\nThe authors propose a novel method called Prompt-based Transfer Generative (PTG) for text generation in a transferable setting.

In the process, the authors present a concept of semantic patterns to communicate knowledge at a certain level of representation.\nThe paper proposes an innovative solution that uses a combination of lexical approaches and language games to reduce the complexity of the semantic problem by shifting from the ontology level to the simpler lexicon level and avoids the use of a centralized third party mediator.\nThe authors evaluate the feasibility of integrating an available discourse analyser called HILDA for a question generation system called CODA and introduce an approach for extracting a discourse corpus from the CODA parallel corpus.\nThe authors propose a framework that presents standards for annotating information status and provides guidelines for annotating information structure, i.e., theme/rheme and background/kontrast, in the Switchboard corpus.\nThe authors present two Propbank annotation tools, Cornerstone and Jubilee. Jubilee aims to expedite the annotation process by displaying multiple resources of syntactic and semantic information, while Cornerstone is an XML editor customized to allow frame authors to create and edit frameset files."
